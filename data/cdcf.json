That there are pressing public issues that might require public debate about public futures or that political debate might draw its vitality from \n\t<em>clashing visions</em> of <em>different futures</em> has faded fast in our post-political and perhaps even post-democratic era.\n</p>\n<h3>\nSocial Futuring\n</h3>\n<p>\n\tIf a serious discussion of material political futures has been largely foreclosed in the world of politics, it is interesting how talk about futures and even utopias is stirring in some radical parts of design and in some emerging quarters of critical theory, critical sociology and the critical social sciences. Let's take one snatch of this conversation – my home discipline of social theory and sociology.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was a figure no less than H.G. Wells (novelist, futurist and serious contender for the first chair in Sociology at the London School of Economics), who argued in 1906 that \"the creation of Utopias – and their exhaustive criticism – is the proper and distinctive method of sociology.\n\t<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[2]</a>\" Now, even if it has to be acknowledged that mainstream sociology has never been particularly comfortable with fulfilling this charge, the \"return of the repressed\" has occurred time and again in sociology and social theory.<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065283156/Wells__2__4fff259f24f5b.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/gF367nKqGXl0gUuyzkS8iZiQf5HNxTghcik91QLPPRtBCwuia62QPcOYUc__FrPTRLs3Hp8HDoVCe3GLmX6WS7Tl3tQ\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/gF367nKqGXl0gUuyzkS8iZiQf5HNxTghcik91QLPPRtBCwuia62QPcOYUc__FrPTRLs3Hp8HDoVCe3GLmX6WS7Tl3tQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption>H.G.Wells 1866-1946</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tFuturist speculation runs through the writings of all the founding fathers of sociology. Marx's vision of an egalitarian future that would be governed by the maxim \"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\" needs little introduction. No less compelling though is Max Weber's icy dystopian fear, that an increasing bureaucratic modernity could give rise to an \"iron cage of rationality.\" For Weber, there was every likelihood that we could end up with a technocratic future governed by \"specialists without spirit; sensualists without heart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLess well known is Emile Durkheim hope, that the dislocations of \"industrial societies\" might be somehow stitched back together through some kind of associational corporatism. Durkheim hoped that isolated individuals might be brought back into social life through engagement with civic institutions, professional groups, trade unions and the like. He further suggested that if these forms of sectional representation were given formal standing, in a reconfigured polity, we could envisage a new kind of associational democracy that represented individuals and groups.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe writing of Patrick Geddes anticipates the substantive concerns of much last twentieth century green politics. In \n\t<em>Cities in Evolution</em> (1915) Geddes advocated an ecologically and socially sensitive form of civic planning that could give rise to a new vision of urban democracy situated in a critical regionalism. These future discussions may well have been disregarded in mid-20<sup>th</sup> century sociology but they were never fully blocked. They leaked out in all manner of ways: from conventional discussions of scenario planning and systems thinking (that draws so much from organizational sociology) to the outright utopian longings of critical theory.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, it is striking how leading contemporary figures in the critical social sciences: from Erik Olin Wright to David Harvey, Roberto Unger to Ruth Levitas, have insisted we must place not just futures, but serious concrete material proposals for reconfiguring our social and political relations back on the agenda\n\t<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\">[3]</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the question of utopia for sociologists has often been treated like everyone's favorite, drunk Uncle at Christmas …..not to be engaged with too much but Christmas wouldn't be the same without him…..the world of design has frequently embraced the drunk uncle or found itself to be the drunk uncle! \n\t<strong> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Design Futuring <br>\n\t<br>\n\t</strong>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065335849/1_cite_industrielle_tony_garnier-13F4698FF4D580F8D4C.png\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/9H5UlTgpGTBvtkUxjGZ13hjofOp-P1O2aj2PKu17Fb4Rkrr-ClYf0HcxLT8vkRV8lKhc1FQBz55XkNFUJLuVsKDMAKCg6Q\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/9H5UlTgpGTBvtkUxjGZ13hjofOp-P1O2aj2PKu17Fb4Rkrr-ClYf0HcxLT8vkRV8lKhc1FQBz55XkNFUJLuVsKDMAKCg6Q=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Tony Garnier Cite Industrielle 1905/1918.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tDesign is important for thinking about futures simply because it is one of the few remaining spaces in the academy that is completely untroubled by its devotion to futures. Prototyping, prefiguring, speculative thinking, doing things differently, failing… and then starting all over again are all core component of design education. This is perhaps why Jan Michl observed that a kind of dream of functional perfectionism\n\t<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[4]</a> has haunted all matter of design practice and design manifestos in the twentieth century.<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065397900/frank_lloyd_wright_1958_the_living_city_1l.gif\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/4hjuxYK63bKgmalPVZpFWMuYWP9aVVvmgbxkIm9sf7c2hyH2WPxH-x2dc9fgIaKhAfROiLQGvVRs5sOXNJBc-e9bl3g\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/4hjuxYK63bKgmalPVZpFWMuYWP9aVVvmgbxkIm9sf7c2hyH2WPxH-x2dc9fgIaKhAfROiLQGvVRs5sOXNJBc-e9bl3g=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tNow, of course, futurism and design have come together with very mixed results in the Twentieth Century. Early modernist architecture, industrial design and utopianism were almost indivisible. From Russian and Italian Futurism to Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus, utopian idealism ruled. Design utopias have acted as powerful historical forces, sometimes to stimulate change and sometimes to recoil from it.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065436574/Amsterdam_Het_Schip_007.JPG\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/fLS9p8ll34YeWBjAHPA2sYQ7yKMdQn1qPkVyxfMnCwTeHvV8nW79V9g2dtWjdIKvy1vmg_lit2K6FzjbDu-aLGZIubus\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/fLS9p8ll34YeWBjAHPA2sYQ7yKMdQn1qPkVyxfMnCwTeHvV8nW79V9g2dtWjdIKvy1vmg_lit2K6FzjbDu-aLGZIubus=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Het Schip by Michel de Klerk Amsterdam 1920.

However, the matter does not end there. There are design utopias and \n\t<em>there are design utopias</em>. And as a growing body of radical designers and architects have suggested, design utopianism by bayonets and bulldozer is not the same as embarking on modes of design futurism as a materialized invitation to political debate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEvoking the possible virtues of design futurism will, of course, immediately generate alarm bells for all good humanists trained with their critical superpower to root out and instantly squash modes of technological determinism and instrumental rationality with the force of a revolutionary key stroke. It will send shivers down the spine of that army of grad school radicals who learned in \n\t<u>Post Structuralism 101</u>, that to be radical is to resist \"cookbooks for the future\" and \"blueprints\"; keep everything open; propose nothing and critique everything. Such suspicions are not to be disregarded. Alan Lie was not entirely off base when he declared, \"design is how we can be dominated by instrumental rationality, and love it, too\"<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\">[6]</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, perhaps it needs to be recognized that the last twenty years of keeping everything open, proclaiming for \n\t<em>radical democracy! Cosmopolitics!</em> \"The Event\" hasn't exactly worked out so well either. Perhaps \"thinking politically\" does require thinking about futures and thinking seriously about transformations of social relations and material relations.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps we were wrong to think that politics is foreclosed by making material propositions. Perhaps the reverse is true: material propositions provide the basis for doing politics. For without concrete material propositions for doing things differently, do we really have anything much to debate in the radical democracy?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps doing \"good futuring\" requires engagement with design because social relations are not \n\t<em>sui generis,</em> as Durkheim was wont to claim, or primarily textual as Derrida occasionally asserted. If Haraway and Latour are correct, that we live in entangled social, material, hybrid worlds<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\">[7]</a>; if we are beset by a whole series of socio-ecological and socio-technological problems, perhaps we need to think about forms of politics that propose <em>socio-ecological</em> and <em>socio-technological</em> solutions? Design utopianism is not a replacement for social critique, but design could <em>potentially</em> add much needed material content to social critique.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut how should we future?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Critical Design, Speculative Design, Architectural Utopianism, Re-directive Practices….<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t</strong>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065751685/Amsterdam-Ave.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/XXgkJi2AGY5oXXb_jl3OGp1SUJUIs2c3GpHQdnuRJSw33xnOGh1RfNCUxnhPd3nTini6vW-l87HPG8PhNE79cXM61M1a\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/XXgkJi2AGY5oXXb_jl3OGp1SUJUIs2c3GpHQdnuRJSw33xnOGh1RfNCUxnhPd3nTini6vW-l87HPG8PhNE79cXM61M1a=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Michael Sorkin Studio: Sidewalks of New York http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/can-nyc-be-completely-self-reliant/<br>\n</figcaption><br>\nThere are presently very different ideas circulating through radical design. The radical Architect Michael Sorkin has demanded a return to design utopianism pure and simple. The condition of utopia, Sorkin suggests, is important because \"it \n<em>proposes</em> its own realization, a deliberation with an outcome.\" Sorkin argues that design utopianism is potentially of central importance for reviving a radical material politics with real material content because: <br>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\t\"Utopian thought is the only way of speculating concretely about a projective connection between architecture and politics. To design utopias is to enter the laboratory of politics and space, to conduct experiments in their reciprocity. This laboratory – unlike the city itself – is a place in which variables can be selectively and freely controlled. At the point of application of the concrete, utopia ceases to exist\".\n\t<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\">[8]</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, if we think of the utopian imaginary as \n\t<em>disposition</em>, as opposed to the <em>blueprint</em>, we might well get a little further in our speculations. Sorkin makes a plausible case for the centrality of a utopian, ecological and political architecture of the future as a kind of materialized political ecology. His intervention can also remind us that hostility to design utopianism or any discussion of embarking on \"big moves\" in urban planning, public housing, alternative energy provision and the like, can itself function as a kind of \"anti-politics\". It can merely re-enforce the status quo, ensuring that nothing of substance is ever discussed in the political arena.<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065810988/inner-gardenview.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/MzhUGLtJVQXVO8PYa1K7yseCxqpFeQZbt8wlDthAW--4UTgEVM110UaHIzxQdxTjR54qR4Q1riLxjPDoqd0V94ym2Bg\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/MzhUGLtJVQXVO8PYa1K7yseCxqpFeQZbt8wlDthAW--4UTgEVM110UaHIzxQdxTjR54qR4Q1riLxjPDoqd0V94ym2Bg=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Michael Sorkin Studio: Sidewalks of New York http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/can-nyc-be-completely-self-reliant/<br>\n<br>\n</figcaption><figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065827278/9780262019842.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/TmnJb-6Md8fdv6vGGKGMPSjrp7rnqSNPBln5wf_QAkQcUxAIJHgKaUobeaRCPlv9Sxk_zd5Ir8E4XADD1_XK5PRQZauN_g\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/TmnJb-6Md8fdv6vGGKGMPSjrp7rnqSNPBln5wf_QAkQcUxAIJHgKaUobeaRCPlv9Sxk_zd5Ir8E4XADD1_XK5PRQZauN_g=s1200\"></a></figure></figure>\n<p>\n\tA very different view of design futuring can be found in the writings and work of Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby.

Fry has observed that our contemporary hybrid worlds are thoroughly designed socio-ecological worlds. And these designed worlds are full of social relations, institutional forms, political economies, infrastructures, and designed items that are literally \n\t<em>de-futuring</em> the planet through their reckless social and ecological impacts. In no uncertain terms Fry argues conventional design has been central to the current defuturing project. Designers have failed to fully understand the disaster of a hyper-consumer economy. There is a failure in design education to recognize that design objects take on a life of their own. As Fry notes<br>\n\t<br>\n\t\"designed things go on designing (be they designed to do so or not)\".\n\t<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\">[10]</a><br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065878356/51GMehBFX%2BL._SX258_BO1%2C204%2C203%2C200_.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/JqpOjSISDkcdleIYFILtyfUhguUJ7JCWtZr0xlgNmj_WUxfZJ-abGg0hzaowSylHO20g4wdpH1ADvvPppokAbGeARNUR\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/JqpOjSISDkcdleIYFILtyfUhguUJ7JCWtZr0xlgNmj_WUxfZJ-abGg0hzaowSylHO20g4wdpH1ADvvPppokAbGeARNUR=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAn inability to think structurally also ensures that design is mostly unable to see that unsustainability or defuturing is ontologically structured into the very 'habitus' we occupy. Fry argues, then, that we need to embrace a form of social design futuring which is interactive and on-going. Fry argues that a critical design futurism has to involve the continued, relentless search for re-directive practices at multiple spatial scales. This will involve systematically retrofitting and redirecting our personal <em>habitus, </em>our homes, our cities and our broader socio-ecological systems to reclaim the future. This will involve a search for 'the quality economy' and new modes of service design. But it will also ensure that in the future design needs to involve not just making, but unmaking. We will need eliminative design.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom a very different angle, Erik Olin Wright and his colleagues have, for nearly two decades now, argued that the critical social sciences should take the exploration and empirical examination of real world utopias seriously. Wright, here, is not talking about setting up Fourier's phalanstère, but \"empirically examining cases of institutional innovations\" that exist in the here and now, and that potentially \"embody in one way or another emancipatory alternatives to the dominant forms of social organization.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn11\" name=\"_ednref11\">[11]</a>\" Wright advocates a form of critical sociology that has little to do with the ungrounded speculative metaphysics that defines so much contemporary critical theory. Rather, he suggests revolutionary work involves deploying a kind of critical, but practical and pre-figurative analysis of \"hard-nosed proposals for pragmatically improving our lives.\" We need to honestly appraise the strengths <em>and</em> weaknesses of concrete proposals that exist now: from unconditional basic income, to appraisals of the Mondragon Co-operative movement, participatory city budgeting to different kinds of associational governance.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065960197/Mondragon.png\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/fodfIzOLdcH6853B5Rk0Sg7Y2vIzhhw_do30M46ePbEW8iUHXw-RS0wd8mLoiLAQWoPB6Rk2RUpKE3w-KOyNkzjp_s_O_A\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/fodfIzOLdcH6853B5Rk0Sg7Y2vIzhhw_do30M46ePbEW8iUHXw-RS0wd8mLoiLAQWoPB6Rk2RUpKE3w-KOyNkzjp_s_O_A=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tWhilst Wright never actually uses the word \n\t<em>design</em> to describe what he is up to in his writings, his demand for concrete programmatic thinking resonates with John Dryzek's call for a critical political science concerned with producing and evaluating discursive institutional designs.<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425065985663/Cities-aravena-2-quinta-011.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/WNx_WO5DEI_buyePmY9KkrZEywEV7ofww9YQtnPM64uK45QYW_1h721ahhXI4c_nNN9pG_RSHApcfWotkpbcgdm8jEnCBw\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/WNx_WO5DEI_buyePmY9KkrZEywEV7ofww9YQtnPM64uK45QYW_1h721ahhXI4c_nNN9pG_RSHApcfWotkpbcgdm8jEnCBw=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Quinta Monroy in Iquique, Chile, designed by Alejandro Aravena. Photograph: Takuto Sando/Elemental</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tFurther points of convergence between design and the critical social sciences open up when we recognize that design is not reducible to the activities of professional designers. As thinkers from Herbert Simon, to Colin Ward have argued, if we see design as a much more generalizable human capacity to act in the world, prefigure and then materialize, the reach and potential of future orientated forms of social design for material politics can be read in much more interesting and expansive ways.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe writings of Colin Ward and Delores Hayden can be fruitfully engaged with here for the manner in which both of these critical figures have drawn productive links between design histories of vernacular architectures and the social histories of self built housing, infrastructure and leisure facilities. Both demonstrate that there is nothing particularly new about the current interest in making, hacking or sharing. There are many \"hidden histories\" of working men and women embarking on forms of self-management, building co-operative enterprises and networks of mutual aid. In doing so they have turned themselves into designers of their own workplaces, communities and lives\n\t<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn12\" name=\"_ednref12\">[12]</a>. Such experiments in what we might call \"worker centred design\" continue to resonate. Attempts by trade unionists to define new modes of ownership with socially useful production (as represented by the Lucas plan), and the recent spate of factory takeovers in Argentina, all indicate that workers can be designers<a href=\"https://thefuturebydesignatrisd.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/#_edn13\" name=\"_ednref13\">[13]</a>.<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425066026111/autonomous-terrace-1.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/zznhLoX1_aJgLasjViT3wvNiCeo_fSnZDC-dxWh9MltLLNXEtt3Q84iZstm167SaEXV9o3VnUqDqR2S_e9wZwWxBuMY\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/zznhLoX1_aJgLasjViT3wvNiCeo_fSnZDC-dxWh9MltLLNXEtt3Q84iZstm167SaEXV9o3VnUqDqR2S_e9wZwWxBuMY=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Illustrations by Clifford Harper for 'Radical Technology' 1976.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tAll manner of interesting potential convergences between critical design, futurism and social critique can additionally be found in the many experimental forms that contemporary urban-ecological activism has given rise to. Consider experiments in urban food growing, forms of tactical or pop-up urbanism, guerrilla gardening and open streets, attempts to experiment in solidarity economies, experiments with urban retrofitting or distributed energy systems or experiments with part finished public housing (that can be customized by their residents). All these currents have the potential to draw design activism and design-oriented social movements into direct engagement with critical theory, political economy and the critical social sciences.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1425066063082/collectivised-gardens-2.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/s1sc9lUSBG97FN9rzB3oQEcBGPz3dWTIUkTtfSglJ7gQ69hZuQWD2pUE0KZnY9VOKIgGr-QdGbjx5rMxhIPasY4sLZY-\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/s1sc9lUSBG97FN9rzB3oQEcBGPz3dWTIUkTtfSglJ7gQ69hZuQWD2pUE0KZnY9VOKIgGr-QdGbjx5rMxhIPasY4sLZY-=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Illustrations by Clifford Harper for 'Radical Technology' 1976</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\t Let us conclude then, that perhaps we do live in worlds where utopias have had their day. If we understand utopias to be static, a-historical projections of \"the good society\" that have already been grounded, prefigured and preordained in \"Nature\", \"History,\" \"science\", then we are probably done with that discourse. If we value democracy, if we want to live in a world marked by a vibrant public sphere that can generate the possibilities of hope and human betterment, then we need futures. \n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWithout futures, and without serious propositional clashes between different materialized futures, we have no politics, and we have no democracy. We merely have millimetric policy disputes that end up as the technocratic attending to marginally different versions of the status quo. \n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can sense these dangers at the moment when we look at the state of our increasingly illiberal democracies. The problems mount: from climate change to spiraling inequality; from crumbling infrastructure to a surveillance state that has no bounds. Yet, our political culture is fixed and frozen. As such, we find ourselves in a culture that can happily spend $250 million dollars per Hollywood movie to create the next sci-fi fantasy but finds it is beyond its imaginative capacities to design superb, sustainable, public housing. We can build fabulously elaborate multiplayer online fantasy games, where gamer avatars can have sex with their elf girlfriends, but providing web platforms that give working people more democratic control over their workplace is a fantasy too far. The potential of self-driving cars or the rise of Artificial Intelligence can be endlessly debated. But the idea that we might be able to regulate our financial institutions is presented as a process as mysterious, dangerous and futile as the attempt to locate Lord Voldermort's horcruxes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Yes, there are future visions still engaged with in mainstream political debate. But what are they: The endless continuation of the neo-liberal present; apocalyptic modes of environmentalism; dystopian fears of the return of the caliphate. \n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can do much better than that. Can't we?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t I have tentatively tried to suggest in this post that one productive route towards generating multiple visions of futures could be cultivated through an alliance between critical forms of design, critical theory and the critical social sciences. To develop this discussion will not be easy. Through engagement \n\t<em>both may have to become something quite different</em>.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\tWe need the capacity, which critical forms of design have, for flights of fantasy, for saying the unsayable, for proposing absurdities. Yet we also need critical social sciences that can engage seriously with design as an equal partner. Design is integral for thinking about futures because design has to propose, prefigure, speculate, protype, anticipate, fail, revise, fail and sometimes succeed. But design can't do it alone. Broader forms of reconstructive political economy, reconstructive institutional analysis, reconstructive anthropology, geography, philosophy, psychology, history, aesthetics and cultural interventions alongside design will all be required to move us forward. This alliance will be difficult to broker at an institutional level but it will also be difficult to broker at the level of the imagination, For it can only emerge if we find ways of being alert to the reconstructive possibilities and potentialities that may exist in the present. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tAs Hannu Rajaniemi has observed: \"Things will appear the same – unless you know how to look\n</p>",

I love riding to work in the snow! Funny to say that,</i> she knows. Years ago such a sentiment would have been unthinkable, especially coming from a dedicated cyclist. The city laid out below her window is quiet and bright, the sun sparkling off the fresh whiteness. With the advent of clean cars, the snowdrifts now stay white for weeks not hours and that fresh clean quiet of new snow lasts. Even the engines of the big rollers are muffled by the falling snow. All vehicles are equipped with high traction tires, so they can navigate slowly over the packed snow. The streets are rendered useful to other travelers as well, cross country skiers and, even the occasional sleigh, now use the streets along with the buses, taxis and the still popular private cars.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1427347583430/ht_angry_catfish_bicycle_ll_130829_16x9_992.jpeg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JaHGm7NZSU7wYX0fZS7d2c7KZolqwujmqGKvhcHOSRkKbSijklSZlkHPTbX36ng8S-piT8qfy7BeqPXrNFF80oyv1VU0\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JaHGm7NZSU7wYX0fZS7d2c7KZolqwujmqGKvhcHOSRkKbSijklSZlkHPTbX36ng8S-piT8qfy7BeqPXrNFF80oyv1VU0=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tLeaving her apartment building in the morning, she stops around the corner at the café, for a quick latte. In the summer the café has a window on the street, a ride through for cyclists, but today it is too cold to drink outside so she wheels in and waits in the bike lane for service. Fresh OJ from local greenhouses is offered even in the dead of winter. The \"dead of winter\" no longer feels like a season of deprivation. Early on, when the locavore movement started, people thought it meant no citrus in winter and only turnips for dinner. This morning, the cold bite in the air, contrasts with the steamy warmth of the café and the tart sweetness of the fresh juice. \n\t<i>Ah</i>, she thinks, <i>the best of both</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCoffee downed, she heads out into the cold winter day, bundled in her riding gear, She remembers, thankfully, that most downtown offices now offer showers and lockers so she can change before her big meeting this morning. The narrow snow-covered swale along the wide sidewalk delineates the bike lane and leads to the broader greenway about two blocks over. Tracing the same path as the storm water from yesterday's snow melt, she is soon on the greenway's broad bike path. Ever since the priority of cycling became a part of city policy, city crews have plowed the bike path as quickly as they clear the bus routes and trolley routes. The wide greenway allows for lots of snow storage and she marvels at the strange ride along the dry clear path lined with steep 6' tall sides of snow and shaded over by the bare branches of the arching elms high above. \n\t<i>Am I really in the city?</i> she muses. Certainly this is not the city she heard about from her mother, who described the harrowing rides in the old city fighting for the narrow strip of asphalt left after dirty grey snow was piled up on the sides of city streets.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1427347691005/london_network.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qE5Vp-SZtvXS5Ppzb3hWu6_6u1O1PKcO_ubOMCwX8P7XbfVMusUIop6Xx3oOh82bLugAlE0tZAyGDdukIA97OCN2fFc2\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qE5Vp-SZtvXS5Ppzb3hWu6_6u1O1PKcO_ubOMCwX8P7XbfVMusUIop6Xx3oOh82bLugAlE0tZAyGDdukIA97OCN2fFc2=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tCrossing the highway overpass, she glances between the dry, vine-covered trellises to see the traffic, buses and light rail surging by in the canyon below, The snow-laden bamboo is bent over in the median strip, and below the bridge the slight hum of the wind turbines can be heard as they capture the turbulence the traffic generates and turn it into electricity. As she enters downtown, she slides up onto the elevated inner-city bike lane. This is her favorite part of the ride, as she zips over intersections without stopping and glides along outside the second story windows of offices. She spies a friend sitting at her desk in a corner office and waves. On the sidewalk below, pedestrians, sheltered under the arcade formed by the bikeway, are looking into the shop windows. The elevated track is always free of snow because it was built with pipes in the lightweight concrete deck that carry solar-heated water.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1427347879099/PastedGraphic-1.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T4i0_w75AdmV8f5NMZvMUGo5tb00XlO-mtmQDO23H7YwafvYaQxMP87DiVHsz-gNemLahBecj2BY20FMX9D3XIESPMUO\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T4i0_w75AdmV8f5NMZvMUGo5tb00XlO-mtmQDO23H7YwafvYaQxMP87DiVHsz-gNemLahBecj2BY20FMX9D3XIESPMUO=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tIn a few minutes she passes the steamy windows of the great block-long greenhouse built on top of the city market. The warm moist air smells sweet and she smiles at the idea of the peppers and fruits growing inside all winter long. \n\t<i>Must remember to pick up some fresh carrots on the way home</i> she notes. Two more crossings, high over the streets and she arrives at the office, and enters directly into the building at the upper floor, wheeling her bike to the bike locker in the lobby and heads for the showers. Some mornings instead, she wheels down the ramp found at the building corner and stops at the newsstand on the way into the main entry.\n</p>",

Between infrared and ultraviolet, \"seeing discovers color\". [2] It is in this space that we are given the experience of the visible world. But we can also imagine what might be discovered beyond this spectrum, beyond its constraints and its affordances, beyond the ends of a continuum that appear distinct, if not in opposition. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tOn the color wheel there is not a seam where there should be. By comparison, on a clock, one finds a \"seam\" between 12 and 1 that is the consequence of the manner in which the representation of time is presented. The linear progression of time is represented as a circle, cycling back around with every hour. On the color wheel, there is the same visual continuity where the \"edges\" of the visible spectrum meet, - between red and violet - as you find between any other contiguous positions on the color wheel. Those edges, seemingly so distinct when seen as a spectrum, meet and fold back around on themselves, establishing a boundary for our facilities of visual perception. But how might we look beyond the horizon of what can be seen? \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t In almost any circumstance, even when there are austere constraints, there are almost always other affordances to be considered, other possibilities to be discovered. There are always new questions to be asked and other design options to be recognized when the territory of possibility is extended; when we expand what can be known (\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme\">episteme</a>) we expand what can be done (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne\">techne</a>), and create new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_of_possibility\">\n\t<i>conditions of possibility</i></a>. With enough time, and in an expanded territory, anything is possible. Creative dialectic, in its most basic formulation, can be characterized thus: as a dialectical process that transcends its own terms and expands the territory of possibility. Creative dialectics are processes that move beyond the edges of a given visible spectrum to see what is invisible beyond. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes creativity,<em> \" as any act, idea, or</em><em> </em><em>product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one</em><em>.\"</em> [3]. The same can be said of creative dialectics.<br>\n\t<br>\n\t Creative dialectics often play out through critique, which can advance and refine what is given, but often takes for granted the terms which have been established apriori. We can assign vectors to this kind of creative dialectic as a move in one of two directions: towards negation (negative critique) and towards synthesis (synthetic critique). The former aligns with convergent thinking, or the search for a correct position within given terms. The latter aligns with divergent thinking, as an open orientation to plural possibilities. [4] One can offer critique by negation, in a reductive or deductive manner, privileging this at the expense of that, making choices as an either/or binary, closing off possibility in favor of a \"correct\" answer. Either \n\t<i>this</i> or <i>that </i>might be true. But we can also make a synthetic critique by building upon what exists already, giving ourselves the dialectical option of non-exclusivity, of both/and, of eschewing laws of non-contradiction with a comfortable affordance for ambiguity between and beyond terms. Both <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> can be true, and neither may be fully privileged or sublated against the other. <br>\n\t<br>\n\t As we close off possibilities to act in one way or the other, as ideas become fixed and find form, opportunity costs correlate to the limits and boundaries placed on the territory of possibility. This is the cost of making the potential real; of moving from a divergent stance to a convergent one. But, as we do, we risk failures of imagination as options are formulated in reductive terms, limited by negation to binary sets: either \n\t<i>this </i>or <i>that.</i> And too often, when we find ourselves in these circumstances of limited possibilities and constrained resources, we are forced into playing a zero sum game.<br>\n\t<br>\n\t A zero sum game constrains the stakes so that everything that is won and everything that is lost equals out. In order for there to be a winner, there must be a loser. Aggregate wins and losses must produce a zero sum. Agents act to optimize outcomes in their interest in a manner that can be characterized as a dialectical relationship, each mutually defining the terms (and identity) of the other in relative opposition or affinity to their own. In a zero sum game, the stakes must necessarily be constrained within this competitive dialectical relation, from which meaning and value are negotiated and exchanged. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t Most of us have some vague intuition that justice is predicated on everything \"equaling out\" in the aggregate; that our burdens and our privileges are constrained, and that the privilege of one must result in the burden of another. And although this is certainly sometimes the case (and in these cases the best possible strategy may be a zero sum game) it becomes ethically problematic when it is assumed that this always or often produces the best possible outcomes and that competition always trumps communication and cooperation as the best possible strategy for addressing inequalities. It becomes a critical problem when failures of imagination inhibit us from recognizing affordances for other possibilities, and we assume that this is the only kind of game we might play and the only way we might play it. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t There are opportunity costs to playing zero sum games, especially when it becomes the default strategy for how we frame difficult questions and address grand challenges. These strategies limit how we negotiate dialectical constructs of identity, power, and justice. If creative problem solving benefits from expanded territories of possibility, from diverse and differentiated positions in dialectical conversation with each other, then what are the costs of playing a reductive zero sum game, particularly when it becomes a primary condition for normative ethics? \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t When the zero sum game is strictly applied to identity and our relations to each other, a problem arises that might be characterized as \n\t<i>the problem of the Other who others another Other</i>. When identities are constructed and constrained oppositionally, mutually determined by means of dialectical negation, as positions against other ideologies, institutions, and individuals, we find ourselves playing a zero sum game. Zero sum games always presuppose an <em>Other</em>. Zero sum activism tends to play out as solidarity with those with whom we have an affinity, with those we identify with, against those we do not; against those agents or behaviors that we consider unjust. Protest is always a struggle against an Other, a resistance against the individuals, institutions, and ideologies that oppose our intuitions of justice. Positive sum activism eschews these reductive constructs and negative critiques. Positive sum activism, attempts to move beyond the constraints produced by this othering, with the question of how we can design better experiences for everyone. Justice, at its best, is a positive sum game. <br>\n\t<br>\n\t To some degree (how much is open to debate) this differentiation, this othering, is always a necessary precondition for constituting our own sense of identity in opposition to and affinity with the positions and identities of others. Who the \"Other\" in question may be is easy enough to ascertain simply by asking who needs to be excluded in order for us to be who we are. What is it we struggle against? What is at stake in that struggle? Who and what must be negated, excluded, or diminished for us to be who we are? But we can also move in the other dialectical direction by inquiring as to whether a synthetic critique is also possible. When we construct our identity strictly in terms of who we are not, as a negative critique, we not only limit the territory of possibility for others, we limit creative possibilities available to ourselves, and we constrain our ability to play and win non-zero sum games.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tNon-zero sum games do not necessarily limit what can be won and what can be lost, and as such can open up space\n\t<i> beyond</i> the given terms. This expanded creative dialectic gives us choice not just <i>between</i> win and lose, but also <i>beyond win and lose, </i>as a win/win or lose/lose. It expands the meaning and value of these terms. This strategy challenges us to consider not just how to get what we want, but why we want what we want, which is to say, what makes it meaningful to win or lose.The terms need not be mutually constrained. Both zero sum games and non-zero sum games can be valid strategies given appropriate conditions. However, the ethical turn we should consider is in the choice of which game to play first and which strategy to privilege over the other.<br>\n\t<br>\n\t Stephen Pinker writes in, \"The Better Angels of our Nature: How Violence Has Declined\", that \"morality is a consequence of the interchangeability of perspectives and the opportunity the world provides for positive-sum games.\" [5] Positive sum games are an enlightened strategy for producing just outcomes because they expand the creative dialectic, providing affordances for new possibilities for all agents rather than reducing the situation to a competitive game and making apriori assumptions about the scarcity of resources and the identities of the agents involved. Agents playing a positive sum game must creatively reframe problems, recognizing affordances for shared value and meaning that might otherwise be missed, considering the needs of all stakeholders, and attempting to better understand the motivating forces in play and the outcomes they produce. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t Positive sum activism, which benefits from and draws on engagement with design practice, can be defined as activism that proceeds from the notion that the grand challenges of the 21\n\t<sup>st</sup> century cannot be solved through solidarity with one group over another, cannot be fully understood through negative/reductive critiques, or won by zero sum games. Positive sum activism is based on the premise that win/wins are far more just, sustainable, and ubiquitous than our normative paradigms of justice might lead us to believe. Positive sum activism can produce a more just world and address <i>the problem of the Other who others another Other</i>. But positive sum activism also places a premium on our capacity to act creatively and empathetically in order to solve problems and expand the territory of possibility. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tWhy is it that we tend to approach discourses of justice in ways that necessarily require someone to lose in order for someone to win? More often than not, when we challenge ourselves to look at problems in creative ways, thinking beyond constraints, designing better affordances for behaviors, and approaching challenges as opportunities to design a better experience for everyone, we find that we can create more for everyone, especially when that design process is iterated and critiqued over many generations. History, after all, is an iterative process.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe value and meaning at stake in any creative dialectic, our attitudes toward scarcity and abundance and the problem of the Other who others another Other are a product of how we understand and approach both the material affordances and constraints of the physical world, and how those affordances and constraints construct our ideas about the value and meaning in play. Creative dialectics produce value and meaning in a dialectical relationship between ideas and material.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are, and for all our history have been, homo faber - humans as makers - who take the stuff of the world and make it useful, meaningful, and valuable by applying our creative faculties to it. We experience it, and try to learn about it, and we apply this knowledge to how we design the world around us to be experienced by us. We apply thought to form, and because thought is constrained differently than the material stuff of the world, we are able to expand the territory of possibility through our faculty of imagination. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t This kind of dialectic has antecedents in the Western metaphysical tradition. On the one side, you have the positions of Idealists, who place thought as primary in determining our notions of reality (e.g. the allegory of the cave). When we make an appeal that this or that as a constructed reality (identity for example), we are making an appeal to Idealism. On the other, you have a Materialist position, privileging the stuff of the material world as ontologically grounding.  From Plato and Aristotle to this day, you find this creative dialectic built into the institutional structures of the academy, with the former tending to find expression in the Humanities, and the latter tending to ground the Sciences. The cross-disciplinary nature of design makes it an especially appealing vehicle for making practical use of these dialectical forces, opening up new territories of possibility between and beyond them. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tThe ways in which we approach constraints and affordances, of both idea and material, determine how we play the game. Built into this choice, and into our notions of identity and justice, are always already certain apriori assumptions about scarcity and abundance. If the world is to creatively manage the grand challenges it faces in the coming decades, especially environmental challenges in the face of growing population, it will be necessary to move beyond zero sum games alone, and the constraints they impose. It is highly probable that over the course of the next century, new possibilities will emerge, manifested in technologies that not only avert Malthusian-like catastrophes, but produce unprecedented abundance for the billions of people who call this planet home. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t Briefly consider three speculative post-scarcity futures with regard to three material resources: energy, water, and space. Each of these brings with it many interesting design questions. Within this century, it is likely that we will design technologies that will allow us to get most of our energy needs, either directly or indirectly, from the sun. The earth receives more energy from the sun in one hour than the world uses in an entire year. [6] One can imagine, that as we shift to a \n\t<em>light economy</em>, we will also find other ways of meeting the material needs of everyone on the planet. We will likely find technical solutions for transforming one of the planets most abundant substances – water – into a clean, accessible, and potable resource for every person on the planet.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEven space is not strictly contingent on geography. Space operates both as a feature of territory and as the map that make that territory meaningful. Space is both a conceptual construct and a physical feature of the material world. Because of this, distinct spaces can be functionally co-extensive. Perhaps the most interesting example of this is the infinitely extendable territory of online space, which overlaps and intertwines with the physical spaces we all occupy. This already has had important implications for how we think about and design blended built environments, how we might move beyond the constraints they impose, and how our attention shapes our reality. The design of the built environment shapes our experiences in fundamental ways, establishing the stage upon which we play our games.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<p style=\"visibility: visible;\">\n\t<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F96809842&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F96809842&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F477531215_1280.jpg&amp;key=31a2d8b5de5447f0b129e81f50af7b5b&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\">\n\t</iframe>\n</p>\n<figcaption><br>\nAn brief introduction to Creative Dialectics for \n<a href=\"http://steamstudio.us/category/projects/\">STEAMstudio</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\t Creative dialectics are processes that concretize the abstraction of thought. But, they are also practices that allow us to experience the world and give structure to insights, insights which emerge aposterori (i.e. from experience). Design strategies of all kinds are creative processes by which ideas become instantiated in the material stuff of the physical world; materials that are shaped and directed toward some given purpose, making objects and experiences meaningful and useful. But creative dialectics are also modes of inquiry, ways of asking questions about how and why, critiquing and testing, translating questions into functional representations… an experience leads to an insight, perhaps then a germ of an idea, that can be represented and shared, benefiting from the critical insights of others, integrating those critical insights into future iterations, perhaps sketches, perhaps models, perhaps text, that can be critiqued again, iterated over and over, moving through multiple modes of representation towards the reified artifact. This manner of critiquing ideas through multivalent modes of representation brings them into the world of shared experience as a creative dialectic. With each iteration a negative and a synthetic critique may be applied, always guided by those sacred questions of \"how\" and \"why\". Each iteration is an opportunity to ask a new question about some feature of the project and how it fits into context.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t There is no single approach to creative practice. There is no single design strategy that is equally effective in all scenarios. And it is important to remind ourselves that these kinds of processes – these creative dialectics - are typically non-linear in practice, but creative dialectics and design strategies of all kinds can help us reach across domains and adopt appropriate practices for the specific circumstances that are being addressed. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t Design Thinking, for example can be characterized as a creative dialectic; as the scientific method applied to creative process. Each iteration is an experiment, with its own hypothesis, methods, and modes of analysis and critique (e.g. negative or synthetic). Human Centered Design's high value on practices that elicit empathy such as storytelling and design research methods is an example of a creative strategy that benefits stakeholders by expanding the territory of possibilities. Human Centered Design can be directly applied to Positive Sum Activism when the \"human\" in Human Centered Design equation, which usually stands in for \"consumer\" or \"end user\", is expanded to include all stakeholders (\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cd-cf.org/symposium/\">see Worker Centered Design</a>). Good design should serve everyone, and it can.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t Bricolage is yet another design strategy, a strategy that draws on the materials at hand to solve a problem or address a need. For the bricoleur, the idea is constrained by the material resources available. This strategy can expand the availability of resources simply by recognizing opportunities to solve problems that are outside of our apriori assumptions about the available resources and their functional fixedness within a given context. Bricolage is a kind of \n\t<i>material alchemy</i>, where what the material does determines what the material is. The trick is in listening to what the material wants to be, considering its constraints and affordances, and applying those resources to the appropriate context. As Claude Levi Strauss put it,\"The 'bricoleur' is adept at performing a large number of diverse tasks; but, unlike the engineer, he [or she] does not subordinate each of them to the availability of raw materials and tools conceived and procured for the purpose of the project. His [or her] universe of instruments is closed and the rules of his [or her] game are always to make do with \"whatever is at hand,\" that is to say with a set of tools and materials which is always finite and is also heterogeneous because what it contains bears no relation to the current project, or indeed to any particular project, but is the contingent result of all the occasions there have been to renew or enrich the stock or to maintain it with the remains of previous constructions or destructions.\" [7]<br>\n\t<br>\n\t These and the other creative dialectics explored above – convergent thinking and divergent thinking, negative critique and synthetic critique, zero-sum games and non-zero sum games, amongst others – are all examples of dialectical constructions that structure our concepts as they limit them. In moving beyond them, in seeking other diverse, sometime contradictory positions, and in concretizing those insights through various modes of representation across different domains, we open up vast new territories of possibility. We might describe this as a transdialectical move; a move beyond. Creative dialectics allow us to explore the spaces between and the spaces beyond, expanding the territory of possibility. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t When our creative faculties are cultivated and applied, iterated and critiqued, no problem is insoluble. Creative dialectics allow us to peer beyond the horizon. They provide a way to see what cannot be seen; to look beyond the gamut of colors, beyond the white light that is combination of all colors, and to know the wavelengths of an expanded spectrum; to glimpse what is further beyond.\n\t<br>\n</p>",

        "article": "<p>\n\t<br>\n\t<strong>Preface</strong><br>\n\t<br>\n\tThis paper was written in September 2014 as a contribution to the storytelling initiative\n\t<br>\n\tof DESIS (Design for Social Innovation and Sustainability) and will be published by\n\t<br>\n\tDESIS to coincide with the Cumulus conference in Milan, June 2015 and is presented\n\t<br>\n\there with their permission. The essay was a response to the following question: Can we\n\t<br>\n\tconsider the act of telling stories of social innovation a political action, as it opens up the\n\t<br>\n\tidea of public realm as a place where decision making takes place? In it I argue for the\n\t<br>\n\tvalue of literature-cum-design critique, not to be confused with \"design fictions\"—the\n\t<br>\n\tspeculative work of designers in visualizing, prototyping and developing 'what if?'\n\t<br>\n\tscenarios. In the work I discuss, design is already in the world. Pandora's box is wide\n\t<br>\n\topen and literature answers \"what if?\"\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<strong>Abstract</strong><br>\n\t<br>\n\tThis paper argues that literature is a fertile source of insight for design research and\n\t<br>\n\tscholarship—in particular, those stories that explore the mutuality of the sentient and\n\t<br>\n\tinsentient, a mutuality pointing to a new kind of politics that respects the reciprocity of\n\t<br>\n\trelations between humans and their environment. Authors such as Charles D'Ambrosio,\n\t<br>\n\tOrhan Pamuk, Darryl Pinckney, and W.G. Sebald are discussed for the ways in which\n\t<br>\n\tthey reposition objects of design (informal and formal) as characters. Chairs, carpets,\n\t<br>\n\tbuildings, manuscripts, and sundry other objects act as protagonists and antagonists that\n\t<br>\n\texceed their intimate relations to individuals and become actors in the larger theater of\n\t<br>\n\thuman affairs. By situating things in the webs of human actions and beliefs, these works\n\t<br>\n\tof literature have the capacity provoke the re-cognition of the activity and outcomes of\n\t<br>\n\tdesigning in shaping the social and political.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<strong>Key words:</strong> aesthetics, design capacities, literature, mediation, politics<br>\n\t<br>\n\tLiterature is a fertile source of insight for design research and scholarship—in particular,\n\t<br>\n\tthose stories that explore the mutuality of the sentient and insentient, a mutuality pointing\n\t<br>\n\tto a new kind of politics. [1] By revealing the qualities and affects of objects and places, [2] by\n\t<br>\n\trepositioning them as characters—protagonists and antagonists, these kinds of stories\n\t<br>\n\thave the capacity provoke the re-cognition of the activity and outcomes of designing in\n\t<br>\n\tshaping the social and political. But it is a capacity that needs to be unlocked. The\n\t<br>\n\tprocess of mining literature for such knowledge would just be a sort of intellectual\n\t<br>\n\tgymnastics were it not committed to what literary critic George Steiner calls \"the politics\n\t<br>\n\tof the primary.\" [3] This is a politics that demands a willingness to meet ourselves and\n\t<br>\n\tauthors in their work, and in doing so, conduct a more fully human exchange.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tIn Real Presences, Steiner calls for a performative criticism. He argues that in re-enacting\n\t<br>\n\tand thus reinterpreting a work (i.e., Homer's Odyssey as reprised by Dante, Joyce, and\n\t<br>\n\tothers), we ingest that work instead of merely consuming it. [4] Furthermore, this particular\n\t<br>\n\tprocess of translation entails an ethics of critique, one that calls for \"answering\" the work\n\t<br>\n\tat hand responsibly. Steiner would have us actively acknowledge the voice (be it\n\t<br>\n\tembodied in a text, an object, a piece of music, and so on) that is speaking to us, and not\n\t<br>\n\tcast it aside for a secondary or tertiary form of criticism of the self-same work. He calls\n\t<br>\n\tfor the same respect for works of art that we accord persons when we answer (rather than\n\t<br>\n\tignore) their spoken questions. Literature is one mode of answering, and the literature\n\t<br>\n\tthat I am concerned with is that which responds to the qualities and capacities of design.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tTo cite just a few examples:\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t• \n\t<em>In Remembrance of Things Past</em>, Proust isolates an aesthetic experience afforded<br>\n\tby a new technology. In this case, it is the telephone, which in the 1920s, requires\n\t<br>\n\ta pilgrimage to the post office and the invention of a new vocabulary. When the\n\t<br>\n\t\"virgins of the wires\" break his connection with his beloved grandmother, the\n\t<br>\n\tphone becomes an instrument of separation, evoking a painful reminder of her\n\t<br>\n\teventual death. But when the technology succeeds, life is not just restored it is\n\t<br>\n\tchanged. His senses operate differently and his behavior changes accordingly.\n\t<br>\n\tThe isolation of sound from image, of voice from face, causes him to speak more\n\t<br>\n\tsweetly: \"what I held in this little bell by ear was our mutual affection… .\" [5] In\n\t<br>\n\tthese passages, Proust offers a recognition of the unanticipated social and sensory\n\t<br>\n\taffects of technology—pressing concerns for designers today.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t• Wisława Szymborska's poem \"The End and the Beginning\" calls on broken sofa\n\t<br>\n\tsprings and window glass shards to evoke the carelessness with which we discard\n\t<br>\n\tthe consequences of one war for another. When Syzmborska writes that \"someone\n\t<br>\n\thas to tidy up… after \"[a]ll the cameras have gone,\" [7] she genders the work of\n\t<br>\n\trepair done by men and women alike. Might not housekeeping be reconsidered as\n\t<br>\n\ta kind of designing?\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t• \n\t<em>The Cave</em> by José Saramago responds to one of those questions. Namely, how do<br>\n\twe come to 'know' matter in the first place? Saramago answers this way:\n\t<br>\n\t\"Anything in the brain-in-our-head that appears to have an instinctive, magical, or\n\t<br>\n\tsupernatural quality—whatever that may mean—is taught to it by the small brains\n\t<br>\n\tin our fingers. In order for the brain to know what a stone is, the fingers first have\n\t<br>\n\tto touch it.\" [8]\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tEach of these works reveals a dimension of (and possibility for) design. For the purposes\n\t<br>\n\tof this forum, however, what follows will concentrate more specifically on writings that\n\t<br>\n\treveal how design (again, in the largest sense of the word) is imbricated in issues of\n\t<br>\n\tculture, identity, race, and by extension, socio-political systems.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tOrhan Pamuk, Charles D'Ambrosio, and Darryl Pinckney are writers whose books are\n\t<br>\n\tunlikely to be found in a library or bookstore shelved under \"design.\" [9] This is because\n\t<br>\n\tdesign is still generally misunderstood as being separate from notions of shaping our\n\t<br>\n\tbeing or projecting how we might be in the future—capacities that are, in fact,\n\t<br>\n\tunderstood to be within the ambit of literature. Eloquent arguments from design theorists\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t(Buchanan, Dilnot, Fry, Margolin, Manzini, Papanek, et. al.) have countered this\n\t<br>\n\tinstrumental view of design for decades. Literature, however, has the distinct potential of\n\t<br>\n\tbringing those arguments to even wider audiences, not to mention the possibility for\n\t<br>\n\tengaging designers in a different way. Literature doesn't instruct. It theorizes and\n\t<br>\n\tspeculates by stealth, under the cover of story. Things, themselves, are literally given\n\t<br>\n\tvoice by Orhan Pamuk; and D'Ambrosio and Pinckney are no strangers to the\n\t<br>\n\tanthropomorphic.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tThese authors use things to speak to particular social conditions in particular places, and,\n\t<br>\n\tthrough them, identify shared human desires, anxieties, and behaviors. They rise above\n\t<br>\n\tparochialisms by activating the tension between the particular and the general, and\n\t<br>\n\tdepending on one's theoretical proclivities, between signifier and signified, between the\n\t<br>\n\tthing and the object. Their work offers arguments that point to various ways of becoming\n\t<br>\n\tmore fully human, paralleling the ways in which design works (or can work) as a catalyst\n\t<br>\n\tfor agency. Finite resolutions are eschewed in favor of provocative questions.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tCase in point: In his novel \n\t<em>My Name is Red</em> (1998), Orhan Pamuk uses the tropes of<br>\n\tinvestigation and interrogation as structure and strategy, as both means and end.\n\t<br>\n\tOstensibly a detective story about the murder of a miniature painter in 15th-century\n\t<br>\n\tIstanbul, \n\t<em>My Name is Red</em>, is, in fact, a debate about eastern and western values, a debate<br>\n\tabout modernity, conducted through form. Throughout the novel, the idealized\n\t<br>\n\tconventions of Turkish miniature painting (and its venerable antecedents) are compared\n\t<br>\n\tboth favorably and unfavorably with the realism of painting in Renaissance Venice.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t • A Turkish tree—actually a sketch of a tree meant to be part of an illustrated\n\t<br>\n\tmanuscript page—says he feels lost because he is not part of a scene of a story.\n\t<br>\n\t(He is also literally lost—having been accidentally separated from the manuscript\n\t<br>\n\tand found in his unfinished state). At the same time, the tree also confesses that\n\t<br>\n\the secretly enjoys the idea of being seen as a singular tree. But for all his\n\t<br>\n\tvacillation, he'd rather be the meaning of a tree [10]—the meaning that comes from a\n\t<br>\n\trelational context.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t• Conversely, a horse drawn in the Turkish style is aggrieved that he and all horses\n\t<br>\n\tappear \"as if traced with an identical stencil twenty times back to back.\" [11] Venting\n\t<br>\n\this scorn for a feminized east, the horse likens Turkish miniaturists to \"ladies\"\n\t<br>\n\twho never leave their houses, never look at real horses, and refrain from drawing\n\t<br>\n\tthe individual features that make him a particular horse.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t• A counterfeit coin circulating in Turkey, but made in Venice, draws attention to\n\t<br>\n\tthe hypocrisy of the West's scorn for the copy over the 'original.' All the while\n\t<br>\n\tthe coin regales his listener the pleasures of his life as a copy. (It goes without\n\t<br>\n\tsaying that all Turkish miniatures are copies and made to keep ancient myths and\n\t<br>\n\thistories not just alive, but intact.)\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tThe tree's ambivalence, the horse's self-hatred, and the coin's cosmopolitan identity are\n\t<br>\n\tall surrogates for social responses to conceptions of modernity: continuity or rupture, or\n\t<br>\n\ta cosmopolitan hybrid of both. The aesthetic debates conducted by Pamuk's characters\n\t<br>\n\tmay seem remote from design as we know it six centuries later, but for the fact that so\n\t<br>\n\tmuch of the horrific violence the young 21st century has witnessed flows directly from it.\n\t<br>\n\tMy Name is Red reveals the ways in which tribal, national, and religious conflicts (and\n\t<br>\n\tcompromises) have their own aesthetic dimensions, and are therefore a matter of and for\n\t<br>\n\tdesign.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tWhere Pamuk's book operates on the scale of conflicting cultural geographies\n\t<br>\n\tcompressed within bi-continental Istanbul, Charles D'Ambrosio's journalistic essay\n\t<br>\n\t\"Russian Orphanage\" (2002) is set against ideological geographies that are\n\t<br>\n\tcommensurately monumental—the legacies of Soviet communism and United States\n\t<br>\n\tcapitalism. In this piece for Nest, a now-defunct quarterly of interiors, D'Ambrosio visits\n\t<br>\n\ta run-down barracks and former prison camp, now an orphanage in Svir Story, five hours\n\t<br>\n\toutside of St. Petersburg.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tHere, D'Ambrosio locates design as the occasion for spatial tactics and strategies devised\n\t<br>\n\tby children. A hole punched into a wall between dormitory rooms functions as their\n\t<br>\n\ttelephone. The tiny architectural disruption serves as a conduit for the exchange of notes\n\t<br>\n\tand a substitute for lost familial connections. The physical and institutional edges of the\n\t<br>\n\torphanage are softened by the wear and tear of daily contact between feet, shoes, and\n\t<br>\n\tstair treads, between hands and railings. What in America would appear as \"signs of\n\t<br>\n\tdecrepitude,\"[12] in this context, are marks of vital social relations within an adoption\n\t<br>\n\tsystem that regularly thwarts it. Here, future parents shop for future sons and daughters;\n\t<br>\n\tmost are left behind.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tFrom the modest material witnesses of abandonment and survival—a scrapbook, bottle\n\t<br>\n\tcaps, shared cigarette butts, D'Ambrosio elicits a picture of ideological differences rooted\n\t<br>\n\tin two different sets of politics that drove the 20th century and are still seeking relevance\n\t<br>\n\tin the 21st. The notion of individualism, which values an \"absolute right to an interior\n\t<br>\n\tself,\" is absent in the orphanage, where codependency is paramount. Clearly the polarity\n\t<br>\n\tof values is not raised to evoke nostalgia for communal systems whose failures appear in\n\t<br>\n\tcongealed layers of paint and broken bricks. From a design perspective, one might argue\n\t<br>\n\tthat instead of fetishizing the scabrous, that focus be put on repairs and systems of\n\t<br>\n\trepairs, and, more generally, the values and possibilities of continuity. Being able to\n\t<br>\n\trecognize that which (and those who) came before us, as part of the palimpsest that is our\n\t<br>\n\tpresent, just might make us feel, as the poet Philip Lopate writes, \"a little less lonely and\n\t<br>\n\tfreakish.\"[13]\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tIn contrast to the vastness of the territories embraced by Pamuk and D'Ambrosio, the\n\t<br>\n\tterrain staked out by Darryl Pinckney's High Cotton (1992) is markedly intimate.\n\t<br>\n\tLikewise, this analysis focuses on only a fraction of Pinckney's novel. Set in the latter\n\t<br>\n\thalf of the 20th century, High Cotton is a coming of age story of a black man, who\n\t<br>\n\tdescribes his family's status (upper-middle class African American) as the \"Almost\n\t<br>\n\tChosen.\" The human propensity for naming and categorizing, reflected in that qualified\n\t<br>\n\tmoniker, here, takes on a profoundly different measure when applied to matters of race.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tOn a visit to relatives in the \"Old Country\" (the American South), Pinckney's narrator\n\t<br>\n\tdescribes his elderly Aunt Clara's living room. In this instance, the design information\n\t<br>\n\tlies less in the particularity of candy dishes, fire screens, and prism lamps, and more in\n\t<br>\n\tthe sum of their parts. The room is a kind of gesamtkunstwerk mirroring a system of\n\t<br>\n\tracial prejudices—a system internalized by an aging Southern black woman, a system\n\t<br>\n\texternalized in the arrangement and density of things.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tHer house was a zoo of things…a wild preserve for the pedestal sideboard… I\n\t<br>\n\twas perfectly free to study the living habits of the lyre-backs in the vestibule… A\n\t<br>\n\tsign on my mother's face said, \"Don't feed the rugs.\"[14]\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tOtherwise commonplace metaphors describing an interior as a cabinet of curiosities take\n\t<br>\n\ton an entirely different cast, or more accurately \"caste,\" when his mother's face is\n\t<br>\n\tlikened to the sort of regulatory notices found in wildlife parks and urban zoos. (Of\n\t<br>\n\tcourse, this is a high-class zoo with lyre-back chairs.) The pointed prose is more than just\n\t<br>\n\ta reference to the incarceration that was slavery. It illuminates one of its consequences:\n\t<br>\n\ta social system among African Americans in which some lay claim to the dubiously\n\t<br>\n\texalted status of an exotic species.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tHere, Pinckney is describing \"a family that thought of itself as inhabiting a middle\n\t<br>\n\tkingdom.\"[15] The language of classification is deliberate. The sitting room's material\n\t<br>\n\toccupants—rug, chairs, and sideboard—are depicted to echo fictions of race plotted on\n\t<br>\n\tpercentages of blood mixtures. (Aunt Clara describes her grandfather as \"seven-eighths\n\t<br>\n\tCaucasian and one-eighth Negro.\"[16]) Such numerical formulations were reflected in a\n\t<br>\n\tless precise but no less affective hierarchy of color. These calculations govern (and are\n\t<br>\n\tsustained by) Aunt Clara, (and presumably others of the \"Almost Chosen), who is prone\n\t<br>\n\tto observations such as, \"Why, you're the darkest one in the family.\"[17]\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tDesignations such as octoroon and quintroon may sound arcane to the 21st century ear,\n\t<br>\n\tbut they persist in the American social imaginary. In its turn toward the social and\n\t<br>\n\tsystemic, design would do well to examine the less obvious sub-systems and hierarchies\n\t<br>\n\tcontained in terms such as race, class, religion, and gender. Just as design systems iterate\n\t<br>\n\tand morph through their deployment, so do social categorizations. Admittedly, design,\n\t<br>\n\tby nature, is interrogatory, predicated on disrupting preconceptions. Yet, none of us are\n\t<br>\n\timmune to the forces of our own experiences, hence concepts of, race, class, religion and\n\t<br>\n\tgender. Pinckney's real gift to design may be the intergenerational perspective of his\n\t<br>\n\tnovel. He models a way to see our inheritances—the frameworks designers bring to\n\t<br>\n\tmatters of concern—at once sympathetically and critically. High Cotton makes the case\n\t<br>\n\tfor the vitality of history in the present.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tThe stories like those of Pamuk, D'Ambrosio, and Pinckney, translated to design, are\n\t<br>\n\tespecially important now that design has been effectively diminished—viewed as either a\n\t<br>\n\tbrand of objects or a brand of management. In evoking the visceral and relational nature\n\t<br>\n\tof things, behaviors, and desires, literature allows us to more fully comprehend the\n\t<br>\n\tpotency of design. A work of literature can cover a lifetime, indeed, generations of living\n\t<br>\n\twith and among things, long after they cease to be thought of as design and become part\n\t<br>\n\tof the fabric of life.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tDesigners can then extract their work from the immersive environment of story, put that\n\t<br>\n\twork under close examination, and revise their plotlines accordingly. In the process,\n\t<br>\n\tliterature can help designers with the work of anticipating the affects of what philosopher\n\t<br>\n\tPeter-Paul Verbeek calls the multistability of objects and their mediations.[18] As we work\n\t<br>\n\tto tell a new story of our place in the world with a view toward sustainment and a politics\n\t<br>\n\tof the anthropocene, literature may serve us better than any manifesto of design. For in\n\t<br>\n\twhat I will call the literature of things, all relations are reciprocal.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tHaving said that, it is also true that there are ways in which both literature and design can\n\t<br>\n\tbe construed as supporting actors in the realm of politics. This would seem to have been\n\t<br>\n\tthe view of Hannah Arendt when she wrote:\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t[A]cting and speaking men need the help of homo faber in his highest capacity,\n\t<br>\n\tthat is, the help of the … builders or writers, because without them the only\n\t<br>\n\tproduct of their activity, the story they enact and tell, would not survive at all. [19]\n\t<br>\n\tThis is literature and artifice interpreted as a residual of political action and speech. In\n\t<br>\n\tusing the verb \"survive,\" Arendt conjures representations that outlast the ephemeral\n\t<br>\n\tspeech and movement of bodies in space. But design is not to be confined to illustration,\n\t<br>\n\tnor texts to documentation. They are themselves modes of speech and action, fully\n\t<br>\n\tcapable of projecting alternatives, formulating speculations, and occasioning political and\n\t<br>\n\tideological debate. Even in memorializing or standing as three-dimensional records of\n\t<br>\n\ttime past, design can redirect attention to the present.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tIn Austerlitz, W.G. Sebald would have it do both, and in the process, defeat time\n\t<br>\n\taltogether. Though at first, Sebald seems to frame design—specifically architecture—\n\t<br>\n\tthrough the lens of retrospection. His use of photography might even reinforce Arendt's\n\t<br>\n\tposition that buildings (as with other works produced by homo faber) testify to ideas but\n\t<br>\n\tdo not generate them. Furthermore, Sebald's protagonist is an architectural historian. His\n\t<br>\n\tjourney to recover a past stolen by inhuman politics of purity of the Nazis could be\n\t<br>\n\tmapped by the landmarks he visits.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tAt one point, we find him in London's Broad Street Station, then under renovation,\n\t<br>\n\twhere he wanders into an abandoned Ladies' Waiting Room:\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tIn fact, I felt, said Austerlitz, that the waiting room where I stood as if dazzled\n\t<br>\n\tcontained all the hours of my past life, all the expressed and extinguished fears\n\t<br>\n\tand wishes I had ever entertained, as if the black and white diamond pattern of the\n\t<br>\n\tstone slabs beneath my feet were the board on which the end game of my life\n\t<br>\n\twould be played, it covered the entire plane of time.[20]\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tAt this juncture, his memories are stirred by a place, fittingly a place of transit.\n\t<br>\n\t(Austerlitz had been sent to Wales during the war along with hundreds of other children\n\t<br>\n\tto remove them from the geography of National Socialist horror.) But the point of\n\t<br>\n\tmemory is as much to explain his existence in the present as it is to discover the fate of\n\t<br>\n\this parents.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tMore pointed is his journey to the Theresienstadt concentration camp from which his\n\t<br>\n\tmother never emerged. Again, the structures are representative of a horrific past never to\n\t<br>\n\tbe deactivated or given agency, except in memory. But the town of Terezín (now Czech)\n\t<br>\n\tis something else. In the muteness of the shuttered village, we sense, with Austerlitz, the\n\t<br>\n\tpolitics of denial. Sebald gives us a window onto the aesthetic of the political. In doing\n\t<br>\n\tso, he lends a different interpretation to Arendt's perspective on the work of homo faber,\n\t<br>\n\tand by extension design. He asks them to bear witness not to embody (or embalm) the\n\t<br>\n\tpolitics of speech and action but to continue the conversation and interrogate it going\n\t<br>\n\tforward.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<strong>A Coda</strong><br>\n\t<br>\n\tI recognize that most of the contributions to this collection are chiefly concerned with\n\t<br>\n\tstorytelling not by gifted writers, but by those people who live with and among the social\n\t<br>\n\tsystems engendered by designed things, by urban planning, by design strategies. Yet,\n\t<br>\n\tone advantage of literature is that it the ability to cover a lifetime, indeed, generations of\n\t<br>\n\tliving with and among things, long after they cease to be thought of as design and\n\t<br>\n\tbecome part of the fabric of life.\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>",

        "article": "<p>\n\tNearly all technology would be appropriate somewhere, so a general meaning of the term \"Appropriate Technology\" is elusive but the term is often used, as I will, in a narrower sense. An accepted meaning is that Appropriate Technology is small scale, labor intensive, creates meaningful jobs, maintainable by the local community, environmentally sound, and energy efficient. A major early proponent was E. F. Schumacher, an economist who visited Burma after World War II and recognized that the technologies effective in Britain and the rest of the industrialized world were inappropriate in much of the world, partly because the capital cost to create a job, a work place, using western technology was prohibitive--£2000 (in 1966). On the other hand, local artisans were using tools costing tools costing £2 and were not producing much.Schumacher argued for an \"Intermediate\" technology, where the capital cost per workplace would be about £100, large enough to be effective, small enough so many jobs could be created.The term \"Intermediate\" was found to be offensive and was replaced by \"Appropriate\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reasons Schumacher pushed appropriate technology in the Third World are probably evident—the capital investment required to create many jobs is not feasible if industrialized world technology is used but would be feasible with a smaller scale technology. Appropriate technology would reach many more people than high technology, reducing economic inequality. A second advantage is that jobs would be created in the villages, avoiding social disruption, such as caused by urban migration. Another advantage expected was that the artisans using these improved but still comprehendible tools would develop attitudes of self-reliance and responsibility. Further, proponents of small-scale technologies believe such technologies are easier on the environment.\n\t<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother reason why \"appropriate\" was used is a reaction to the many attempts to transplant a technology into a situation where it did not fit. Machines that worked well when used and maintained by experienced operators in Britain and the US failed permanently at the hands of untrained staff lacking support. When machines were exported to less industrialized regions, spares and lubricants did not always follow. Local people tend to be ingenious and motivated but are at a tremendous disadvantage without the engineering ecosystem we take for granted. A gross simplification, which has a kernel of truth, is that people in less industrialized countries have an excess of time and a lack of capital. The opposite is true in industrialized countries; hence the risk of transplanted technology being inappropriate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne concern about appropriate technologies is whether it can produce sufficient goods and services to meet needs. The answer, of course, depends on the situation and the technology chosen. Another concern is whether users or designers will accept a simple solution when a more complicated one is available—perhaps this bias toward complexity is a North American phenomenon. I suspect people doing planning for third world nations have a concern that promoting appropriate technology will permanently exclude a nation from participating in modern industry. A suspicion may exist that appropriate technology is in fact a strategy to keep less industrialized nations that way forever. A final concern about appropriate technology is that it is difficult to manage because it supports self-reliant artisans working on locally selected projects.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHow did thinking about appropriate technology evolve? In the first place appropriate technology is becoming accepted. I am struck when I visit places in Africa and Asia that appropriate technology is recognized as a viable option. In the United States people seem less familiar with the term but the ideas are gaining hold.Thinking about appropriate technology changed in another way—a recognition that technology is only part of the solution. In the Third World, aid organizations that once focused heavily on designing devices are now focusing more on the entire value chain—realizing that creating jobs requires attention to suppliers and customers, as well as technology. A third way that thinking has evolved how local people are involved. At least some aid organizations are paying much attention to existing community knowledge, choosing technologies that build on what the community has been doing, using appropriate technology ideas to help people do things better.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, is appropriate technology really useful beyond helping poor farmers in remote places?Are the ideas applicable in other contexts?I see several generally useful themes coming out of the appropriate technology effort:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Bias for simplicity, for small scale solutions</li>\n\t<li>Avoidance of technology that creates major cultural change</li>\n\t<li>Recognition that successful innovation requires more than technology advances </li>\n\t<li>Being attentive to the quality of jobs produced</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tSchumacher would be disappointed that community development is not included but appropriate technology ideas do not seem to be leading in that area.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI should elaborate. People become engineers because they like to make things. They feel rewarded when their solution to a challenging problem works and often feel more rewarded when the solution is sophisticated. This aspiration for technological elegance can overcome awareness of what is needed. Aiming for perfection narrows a designer's vision.\n\t<i> </i>A solution that satisfies and is meets other requirements is needed in many cases, especially in unfamiliar settings, and such a solution is very likely to be small scale\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAppropriate technology tends to be close to the traditional technology so the cultural change required when it is introduced is usually small. The work people do after the new technology is introduced is similar but more productive. Successful implementation of appropriate technology has, in most cases, focused on villages—where poor people tend to live. Having productive jobs in a village retains village culture, easing the adjustment to the different sort of life a new technology will bring. The admonition to the engineer introducing a new technology is to learn about the existing culture and forecast, as best as possible, the affect of an engineering advancement.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe history of appropriate technology, and other instances of attempting technology change, is that for sustainable improvement much more must be done than simply deliver a new device. Certainly problems of spares and lubricants must be addressed but broader problems must be considered. For example, how will the customer get the cash to pay? Who will sell the new technology? Who will buy the output? Must insurance be provided and who will organize that? And so forth. As noted, improving devices is not sufficient for significant change.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo genuinely improve people's lives better jobs are needed, as well as more jobs. One aspect of a better job is being more productive, so some sort of a surplus is created. Anecdotes abound of how a better tool has taken a farmer or artisan out of poverty to middle class, allowing, for example, school fees to be paid and a cement floor installed in the home. Another aspect of a better job is giving opportunities for users to think resourcefully and to advance themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA technology is appropriate, it seems to me:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>If it produces sufficient goods and services, </li>\n\t<li>If the capital needs are reasonable, </li>\n\t<li>If it matches local resources, both physical and human</li>\n\t<li>If the user can understand and maintain it,</li>\n\t<li>If it does not cause a major cultural disruption,</li>\n\t<li>If it fits into a viable value chain,</li>\n\t<li>If it promotes responsible jobs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>",

        "article": "<p>\n\tAs part of its attempt to resituate the practice of designing within a commitment to facilitating social change toward more sustainable futures, the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University has started talking about 'Transition Design.' It is risky to invent yet another term which too easily looks like an appropriative branding exercise. But it can also be useful as way of marking an ambition. The following is a further attempt to explain the differences from existing practice to which Transition Design aspires.\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Assumptions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1) There are crises</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428336270510/unnamed.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3VZ-yNg43FQaL_70O48Hae1jOfDL8N5rP_02vwiEtT1dVlzmixgTk0VGIJlp1mNWwK5a_9Qqko-c3KyRUVymMOZ9R6mrMw\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3VZ-yNg43FQaL_70O48Hae1jOfDL8N5rP_02vwiEtT1dVlzmixgTk0VGIJlp1mNWwK5a_9Qqko-c3KyRUVymMOZ9R6mrMw=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 1: We are still in crisis even if we have crisis fatigue – from Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi (1983)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design assumes that the dominant, or at least dominating, ways of living today are not sustainable. How the global consumer class resource their lives is damaging the ecological impacts upon which those lifestyles depend and entails increasing inequality that excludes many from that class and even diminish the capacity of most in that class from living as they intend.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design accepts the too often repeated litany of current ecological and social stresses: diminishing access to readily available fossil fuels, potable water, top soil, rare earth elements, etc; mass extinctions and major ecosystem transitions; structural racism, sexism, classism, etc. Transition Design also works from the assumption that all these social stresses are interlinked; no one instance of these crises can be solved in isolation from the others. This also means that Transition Design is motivated by the belief that most current initiatives directed at these problems are futile or misdirected.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Transition Design can and should be of value to existing commercial design practices, without this sense of crisis Transition Design seems pretentious. If you believe, as many do, that this litany of crises are fabrications or exaggerations, or if you admit that these are problems but believe that business-as-usual is progressing in ways that will successfully deal with these problems, then Transition Design will seem superfluous or dangerous.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, a central assumption of Transition Design is that whilst our societies are in crisis, these crises are not being, and will never be, experienced in sufficiently motivating ways. There is never going to be a crunch time necessitating Promethean responses. These are slow motion crashes with which humans, especially while still moderately wealthy, are adept at coping. Transition Design, as with the Transition Town movement by which it is inspired, attempts pre-emptive change before change is unavoidable (which this may be never).\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2) Design is crucial</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428336295912/unnamed(8).jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GjP6YamI5cfDKiwwvXwUQlYM9mdGUxodaEQBtHaHJV2RxsmRt8diaQA7C-UVfRGvprZO9R_vYldXqpAEpUJEFXWRNzaQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GjP6YamI5cfDKiwwvXwUQlYM9mdGUxodaEQBtHaHJV2RxsmRt8diaQA7C-UVfRGvprZO9R_vYldXqpAEpUJEFXWRNzaQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 2: Humanity is a product of design    –<br>\nfrom Stanley Kubrik's 2001 (1968)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe dominant forms of consumerist living are dependent on design. The interface between everyday habitual practices and the unsustainable economies and infrastructures that resource them are designed artifacts, environments and systems; socio-ecologically exploitative industries manifest as clothes I wear while accessing my bank through an app on my cell phone as I sit in a car at traffic lights with the air conditioning on.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis quotidian ubiquity of designed products is perhaps the reason why design is often missed as axial to our societies and their unsustainability. Being a relatively recent profession and not yet a discipline, understandings of design are not commensurate with its importance, even by designers themselves. Current work in the sociology of technology is only just now articulating the sociomaterial power of designed things. The ways in which designs influence how people act, making certain activities and their associated product ecologies inertial, are central to explaining how our societies are so unsustainable – just as they are crucial to shifting our societies out of current crises. Transition Design assumes that designing must play a central role in the systems-level change that our societies need to undertake. By assuming the need to foreground design, Transition Design is as much a challenge to other forms of psychological and social change as it is to forms of designing that believe they are powerless service providers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3) Design is in Transition</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428336332541/unnamed(1).jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_NOB9_t-vOPEkeErHJ3DzcFWBq3o83t6DEEUphrlVT4KsQ3cM8Tddooa67L1BNQ22cITE3ArbpLX_tb_QDMbkbkDgn4\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_NOB9_t-vOPEkeErHJ3DzcFWBq3o83t6DEEUphrlVT4KsQ3cM8Tddooa67L1BNQ22cITE3ArbpLX_tb_QDMbkbkDgn4=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 3: Every design prototype should be a product on the market</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tDesign is both the product of and the producer of modernism. Shaping material things became the art and science of interfacing between mass production and mass consumption. However, perhaps half-a-century after being predicted, developed economies are now post-industrial. Service sectors, information economies and digital platforms dominate new business.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a result, design appears to be undergoing one its most significant transformations. The conventional design process of contextual inquiry, ideation, prototyping and fixed final product is being by displaced by data-driven into-the-field releases of constantly modifying systems (consider the role of a 'product designer' at Facebook for instance). The in-house innovation teams of large technology, and even financial companies, are challenging design consultancies. Meanwhile, design thinking is becoming mainstream in schooling, the liberal arts and business.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of these shifts, which reflect wider changes in late capitalist neoliberal economies, mean that the practice and discipline of design are currently in transition. Transition Design is based on the assumption that these transitions in the professional practice of designing are important opportunities for design education and research to demonstrate bold leadership. Practitioners and sponsors of design are looking for more comprehensive ways of negotiating change and complexity. There is consequently an openness to change-oriented values-based designing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tContexts\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4) Sustainable Design was too Problem-Solving</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428336368178/unnamed(7).jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/16_XsZaCtvvKpmfiesGkaYroUjWWBwz5csiFEtOtlwkFudoEoqytCAG4npgWps8_CZrqeWJLU3GxDsLS6xEiZDzeu8HY\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/16_XsZaCtvvKpmfiesGkaYroUjWWBwz5csiFEtOtlwkFudoEoqytCAG4npgWps8_CZrqeWJLU3GxDsLS6xEiZDzeu8HY=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 4: You have to walk before you can fly – after Han Brezet; from http://systeminnovationforsustainability.com/2012/06/11/system-innovation-for-sustainability-using-systems-thinking-and- design-thinking/</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tDesign has always sought resource efficiency: the minimalist functionalism of modernism aimed to do more with less. Designers have been explicitly concerned about the ecological sustainability of their products since the 1970s. At that time, the Oil Crisis showed many designers that work they were doing for developing nations (what was called intermediate technology transfer) was also relevant to developed nations. Ecodesign became central to the discourse of Sustainable Development promoted by the UN in the late 1980s.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, the results fell short of these ambitions. The supply-side focus of the early 1990s – Cleaner Production, Ecoefficiency – reduced the rate of ecological impact of business-as-usual but did not lead to net impact reductions. In addition, economic growth increased the overall volume produced, outstripping resource efficiency and pollution reduction efforts. In the later 1990s and early 2000s, emphasis shifted focus to the demand-side – Sustainable Consumption – but failed to deal with the Rebound Effect – when money saved by going 'green' was re-spent on other eco-impacting activities. This is why current Sustainable Consumption efforts focus on social psychology derived value-based behavior change.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the mid-2000s, Sustainable Design researchers recognized that the focus should not be on impact reduction but system change: how to make large-scale shifts in infrastructure, such as fuel-switching to distributed renewable energy systems; and how to radically transform consumer economies – from linear ownership-based models (resource extraction &gt; manufacturing &gt; retailing &gt; domestic use &gt; waste stream) to circular usership-based models (product service systems). There is now a strong discourse of 'Sustainability Transition Management' exploring Multi-level, Multi-stage Sociotechnical Changes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design is explicitly connecting to this systems-level change version of Sustainable Design. It aims to bring design's human-scale artifact-interaction focus to the transformation of everyday practices needed to enable structural transitions to more sustainable economies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5) Social Design was too Problem-Solving</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428336402424/pathways2.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/okQ2YOIf1cV4Gsh-nvEGSzCtFTAtk-vAZnslx466lmcZ8_jsbGrKvZ37lQJO4L9myoIlOEe1eSv5PC5476tj_KadMEwF\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/okQ2YOIf1cV4Gsh-nvEGSzCtFTAtk-vAZnslx466lmcZ8_jsbGrKvZ37lQJO4L9myoIlOEe1eSv5PC5476tj_KadMEwF=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Figure 5: The aim is not to get to the top right, but too many projects are bottom row – illustration by Craighton Bermann, from http://www.socialdesignpathways.com/<br>\n<br>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tDesign has always also been a form of Social Design: from the worker-oriented Arts and Crafts movement, through the social-utopia vein in the various iterations of the Bauhaus, to the other-90%-directed designing promoted by Victor Papanek. The latter, which is currently dominant (e.g., IDEO.org, Frogimpact™, etc) tends to be ameliorative rather than politically pursuing structural changes. This is changing as wealthy philanthropists embrace design and design thinking, funding larger scale and longer term social entrepreneurship.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWork by Ezio Manzini's DESIS (Designing for Sustainability and Social Innovation) represents a shift in method and objective. Rather than being design-led, DESIS work lends service design expertise to existing community initiatives. Despite this localized focus, the work is committed to wider social change, via 'scaling-across,' since the initiatives it helps redesign represent non-market and often also non-governmental, ways of resourcing everyday life. In this way, DESIS advances alternative economies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Social Design Pathways matrix was developed in part by people interested in articulating the need for more ambitious, longer-term forms of Social Design, including some of us now developing ideas around Transition Design. For us, Transition Design articulates a commitment to structural social change beyond social problem-solving.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Heuristics\n\t</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">\n\t6) Design needs to rethink its relation to the Future</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428318541897/7.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N7-08fnWZIEQPQheSDTuZOjfBsQXh6x899HvXigQ9nFhGnevjqbsnOStPLkNESGhY1Ou0XKkyXOBdnFGUIJq7O2V2W8\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N7-08fnWZIEQPQheSDTuZOjfBsQXh6x899HvXigQ9nFhGnevjqbsnOStPLkNESGhY1Ou0XKkyXOBdnFGUIJq7O2V2W8=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 6: We live unsustainably in the world Modernist Designers Envisioned – Futurama from New York World's Fair 1939\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tDesign is the process of deciding on and then realizing preferred futures. The modern practice of design arose early in the twentieth century in North Atlantic countries as the development of strong visions for otherwise quotidian objects: the minimalistic machine aesthetic signaling the universal ahistoric human at the Bauhaus or the streamlined subject of ever-changing technocapitalism in the US. As Damian White has documented (see \"Critical Design and Critical Social Sciences\" http://www.cd-cf.org/articles/critical-design-and-the-critical-social-sciences/), the discourse of design has always maintained this utopian tendency, now apparent in visualizations of smart green future cities on the one hand or cyborgian singularity on the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, the professional practice of design today has a strong counter-tendency to abdicate from futuring. Talk of complexity, disruption and constant change suggest that the future is unanticipatable: risks are black swans and value lies in fickle movements of crowds. Consequently, the job of commercial design, especially in the realm of digital platforms, has become to remain agile, constantly building alternatives in response real-time analytics, rather than to pursue a vision.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design counters with a revived insistence on design taking responsibility for the futures it materializes. This should be more dynamic than the Procrustean visioning of modernism, but it should have a more forceful sense of what kind of society it is contributing to building.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>7) Design needs to have much more explicit Theories of Change</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428318579513/8.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C690dCxvHXBWCw7I7n9slk0rI7mSgEbxo9Q_XvKPMctl5RFVT9SZRzCXSHE7TGHQGixVPPWHEwQjIALl6MBZ8GGS0yY\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C690dCxvHXBWCw7I7n9slk0rI7mSgEbxo9Q_XvKPMctl5RFVT9SZRzCXSHE7TGHQGixVPPWHEwQjIALl6MBZ8GGS0yY=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 7: Designers often take for granted their agency within incomplete systems – from Southpark Episode 17, Season 2 (December, 1998)\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tAs design has matured over the 20th century and into the 21st century, it's scope and influence has grown. Design has shifted from the problem-solving activity of giving form to new technologies, through the problem-reframing activity of new product development, to the research and change practices of design thinking applied to management and social issues. However, in cases of the latter, designing often assumes the same rationale as informed the former: artifacts (communications, products, environments) designed with human-centered principles can make activities easier, more productive or enjoyable. The 'Models of Man,' as Herbert Simon called them, that underlie much Design Thinking are ones that cast humans as a combination of lazy and hedonistic; individuals (almost never treated as members of communities in any profound way) are only ever semi-rational, and hence need to be nudged or gamified by designs that makes things simple or rewarding.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe kinds of expanded social fields in which design now aids innovation and change are precisely ones in which humans need to be acknowledged as being more complex than marketing's notion of consumers. These are people with strong social commitments and complicated ethics, groups of people often prepared to engage in effortful interactions that do not have immediate benefit. These contexts afford and demand a wider palette of interactions and design rationales.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design is a deliberate attempt to update the theoretical frameworks informing designing, especially design directed at structural, long-term sociocultural change. It tries to apply all that has been learned recently about individual and social change, as well as innovation diffusion and the social histories of large-scale technologies and infrastructures. These accounts of modern material cultures and sociotechnical practices equip designers to be powerful change agents without losing their core craft expertise.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>8) Design needs to take responsibility for its Sociality</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428336492586/unnamed(1).png\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B1Uo1BfjoZQqZ2iVJ2skHDIEoNuP5Rf4sQ3Uc5-hvPuuwJPTp_dyjfm0gvHoEAMwZL0vR5A1HO0a-Vxdd8Tlo4gkv6Oe\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B1Uo1BfjoZQqZ2iVJ2skHDIEoNuP5Rf4sQ3Uc5-hvPuuwJPTp_dyjfm0gvHoEAMwZL0vR5A1HO0a-Vxdd8Tlo4gkv6Oe=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 8: Design has a social epistemology: charisma is a form of validity – October 31, 1949</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tWhilst most designed artifacts are effectively anonymous, the history of design is often the biographies of iconic designers. The creation of the modern practice of designing was accompanied by strong personalities that were as deliberately designed as their products: think of Raymond Loewy's explicit project of self-promotion, no less than Walter Gropius.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is perhaps a necessary aspect of the fact that design is a 'science of the artificial.' Design brings things into existence, things that can then become crucial to our everyday life. This kind of world-making is not just a physical skill, but necessarily a social one. A wide range of people must be convinced to lend their money and materials and components and time and skills to realizing a particular design. Being a charismatic visionary is evidently one way that design has performed the social work of gathering allies for materializing a preferred futures. However, this strategy clearly has its limits and there are many other cultures that designers could employ.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design foregrounds these questions of the social roles designers need to play to accomplish large-scale change in situations of urgency and crisis. Central is the recognition that design in realms of social complexity implicate the designer in what is being designed. This is quite distinct from conventional commercial design where the designer is making products for a client and primarily a set of users in different segments from the designer. Any Transition Design project also entails a redesign of the knowledge, values and practices of the designer as well; Transition Design is always what John Chris Jones called Designing Designing, or Tony Fry Redirective Practice.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Techniques</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>9) Multi-stage</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428336521113/unnamed(4).jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sJ-Z3fSiG_F29-Bk_pg8P5zVd8oZzryu0NjV7K4JiIRfesjHmgKymxlPmeMuRfPINIQfZQl4SWAgddiJK8UK-B-QU8Q-6w\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sJ-Z3fSiG_F29-Bk_pg8P5zVd8oZzryu0NjV7K4JiIRfesjHmgKymxlPmeMuRfPINIQfZQl4SWAgddiJK8UK-B-QU8Q-6w=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 9: There is no future, only the futures of futures – by The Extrapolation Factory (Elliot Montgomery &amp; Chris Woebken) https://extrapolationfactory.wordpress.com/about/</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tDesigning to date has been primarily problem-based. This means that each design project tends to have a stopping point. There is an end-product. When the money for a dead-lined project runs out, the designers are rarely completely satisfied with the outcome – perfectability is an inexhaustible motivator for design. Nevertheless, the consultancy model of designing that has been dominant for the last century encourages the designer to move on to some other very different kind of project.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis episodic way of working perhaps explains the notoriety Horst Rittel attained amongst design researchers with his notion of a 'wicked problem' – a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point. Transition Design explicitly locates itself within the domain of 'wicked problems' because it involves a kind of designing that 'stays with' a problem.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the one hand, this 'taking responsibility for ongoing work in the one context' that defines Transition Design is a challenge for the psychology of the designer. When you are in for the long haul, the satisfiers are less direct and regular. On the other hand, this aspect of Transition Design is just a re-emphasis: it plays up that designing is a project-based practice, one whose expertise lies in its capacity to make strategic interventions in contexts. Designing is always a process of action research, coming to understand by making changes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is therefore a distinct technique of Transition Designers is attention to multi-stage multiplier effects. A Transition Designer designs something not to be an end-unto-itself, a final solution to a problem, but to open up subsequent opportunities. Any design must solve some problems, but the point is to always also ask what new options are generated by the conditions that successful design generates. Transition Designers ask \"… and so … and then …\" Designing a digital service system that enables people to ride-share creates new habits and expectations that Transition Designers immediately seek to take further, scaling-across to other ways of living and working to create large structural economic and cultural change.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThough longer term thinking is inherent to Transition Designing, this practice is not like strategic planning. The multi-stage quality of it means that after each accomplishment, the way forward needs to be re-evaluated because unanticipatable consequences will have arisen. Transition Designers in this way seek to see round corners, moving in one direction not in order to get at the end point, but instead to discern other change-possibilities afforded by having shifted current conditions through the insertion of new designs and designed activities.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>10) Practice-Oriented<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t</strong>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428318718290/11.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0L2x-8_f9-hnG0EgZG6v2zQLo3HI6lIJJthCqCz0Tb9CgRg8VXTcuNVmo2aNpxIEwoXrT8RLYbjtgnRm2ej_JBBNNF4\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0L2x-8_f9-hnG0EgZG6v2zQLo3HI6lIJJthCqCz0Tb9CgRg8VXTcuNVmo2aNpxIEwoXrT8RLYbjtgnRm2ej_JBBNNF4=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nFigure 10: The form of the artifact reflects its non-linear history of use\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tDesign is the art and science of making useful things, but as indicated in 2 above, those things, when well-designed, become transparent to the activities their use affords. This leads to a conundrum inside and outside of the discourse of design. Designers tend to focus only on the material things they produce (episodically – see 9). Designers often have to be reminded by design researchers and managers that their really object(ive) is enabling activities. Social researchers by contrast have almost entirely ignored the central role played by everyday designed artifacts, foregrounding instead immaterial things like values, meanings and identities.\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOnly recently have social researchers begun to effect Material and Thing Turns in their analyses. Exemplary is the Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory (edited by Karin Knorr Cetina,Theodor Schatzki &amp; Eike von Savigny, Routledge, 2001). These perspectives incorporate insights from the field of Sociology of Technology Studies and propose that practices be considered a basic unit of society. A practice is a constellation of devices, skills and meanings that coheres as an everyday only-ever semi-conscious activity: breakfasting, commuting, work meeting, skiing, dating, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the merits of Social Practice Theory is that it can explain how inertial our modern societies are despite media celebrations of constant technological development and economic change. Despite all the new inventions of the last half-century, the global consumer class still lives on a day-to-day basis in much the same way: eating, laundering, transporting, even schooling and holidaying, have not changed much as practices – with continued social and ecological impact consequences. The invention of new devices is only ever one third of the problem of sociotechnical change. Any innovation must adapt to existing skills and meanings or assist in the development new ones to be incorporated into everyday life. Similarly, any new value – ecological or social sustainability as a new 'meaning' for instance – will not 'take' unless it can be materialized into devices that significant groups of people have the capacity to use habitually.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor designers, the way Social Practice Theory accords structural significance to devices and their skilled use at last registers the value of design to how we live our lives and organize our societies. By corollary, Social Practice Theory demands that designers acknowledge their responsibility for determining how our societies are made durable (to paraphrase Bruno Latour).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design is a form of Social Practice Oriented Designing. Its tactic for bringing about structural change (4 and 5) targets multi-stage change (9) of practices.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKey here is a somewhat new timespace of designing (see Theodore Schatzki The Timespace of Human Activity, Lexington Books, 2001). As discussed above, design evaluates preferred futures in the studio, though this is currently under pressure from the agile data analytics driven approach to product development that demands early fail-able beta-releases into the field. Social Practice Theory suggests something in the middle: groups of people need to be able to trial new everyday practices. It takes time to learn and then embed new devices and/or meanings, so the design of practice changes requires venues like Living Labs. Whilst 'in real life' and involving lay people, these are not into-the-field releases, but carefully designed experiences. In Transition Theory, these are referred to as 'Niche Experiments.' They are semi-protected domains in which new devices, skills and meanings can co-evolve. When robust, these new social practices can then be reproduced or translated more widely.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTransition Design is an attempt to name an ambition for an expert craft of designing that acknowledges the extent of our social crises by advancing the practices of social and sustainable designing through the incorporation of multi-stage practice-oriented transformation.\n</p>",

        "article": "<p>\n\t\"Chinese Opera is embedded in the landscape of China, just as iron ore is embedded in the Australian landscape\", remarks Providence-based artist Daniel Peltz, in explaining how it came to be that he proposed to re-enact the displacement of minerals occurring in mining super-town Tom Price by producing a traditional Chinese opera there. As part of the WA-based <i>SPACED: Future Recall</i> residency program, Peltz will spend 8 weeks in Tom Price over one year, working with its community groups and liaising with the big fish in that small pond, Rio Tinto Iron Ore. His residency has already begun to lay bare the mechanics of living in a company town, the huge scale of iron ore production, and the astonishing movement of infrastructure it requires.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDescribed another way, the resources industry in Australia is a cycle of value extraction. A worker completes an intensive 'swing' at site with the promise of a high value burst of income. Wages in Tom Price are well above average, making it the most affluent regional town in Australia. Next, mining companies dig value right out of the ground, in incredible bulk and at a carefully managed rate of efficiency. Cost-benefit analyses underpin all procedures, including water recycling, flora re-habilitation and employee support services. Lastly, Chinese companies buy the ore and process it into steel. Labour in China is cheap, or we'd make the steel here. Peltz sees these cycles at work in Tom Price, \"a town who's reason for being is to plant charges in its rock faces, dig out its insides, load them on trains and ship them to unseen factories, where they are deemed more valuable.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThomas Moore Price was the Vice President of Kaiser Steel when he first flew over the site of the town that would take his name. Looking below, he declared that if God had provided such richly endowed landscapes, surely they were meant to be dug up and used. \"I chose to focus on him,\" says Peltz, \"and to think of my insertion into the history of Tom Price as a sort of re-enactment.\" Enlisting Rio Tinto, Price oversaw the transformation of Tom Price Mountain into an open-cut chasm, producing millions of bankable tonnes of iron ore to be processed at Kaiser's $260 million steel mill in Fontana, California. This industrial lore paints a picture of Price as some patriotic, pipe-smoking Upton Sinclair character, turning dust and rock into dollars. Nevertheless, Kaiser was bankrupt by the 1980s and the mill sold to China. 300 workers from the Guangxi Province were flown in to dismantle the plant and reinstall it in Asia, and Tom Price continues to supply its ore.<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428323661330/IMG_4338.JPG\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WkCLBAjcfA8IAA6vblLVKGWlutCGdlqEj8obide2XyOsHd9lfnZXeNMRTeTQFpl1A6rJzEz_rGmJhRqh_TM0KDRkaIxXTQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WkCLBAjcfA8IAA6vblLVKGWlutCGdlqEj8obide2XyOsHd9lfnZXeNMRTeTQFpl1A6rJzEz_rGmJhRqh_TM0KDRkaIxXTQ=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tInto this crucible of investment, land and infrastructure steps Daniel Peltz, an artist fascinated by communities whose rhythms are mediated by the marketplace. Being new to a WA country town should presumably be an experience of conspicuity, of being a stranger; but Tom Price is different. There are no dynastic families with long-held pastoral footholds to cast suspicion on outsiders. Residents are mostly fulfilling a 5-year plan at most, before returning home and being replaced by others. Peltz is their peer. \"I'm not so different from all the other contract labor in this company town\" he considers, \"I've been sent here to mine, to craft a life from the excess. I'm drawn to the itinerant nature of this town\". Neither Peltz nor the short-term workers will buy a house or run for council in Tom Price, starting something they'd later have to abandon or uproot. Peltz is therefore skeptical of labeling Tom Price a \"community\" (instead cushioning the word in quotation marks). This is not because there is no good feeling among its residents, but because a community is by definition static. \"I've harmonized with my status as a temporary resident, which is naturalized in this context,\" he says. Those who witness his presence will move on. The landscape itself is daily blasted and minced and taken elsewhere. That the history of his residency will be fractured and exported in the same way is Peltz's methodology.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving completed his first four-week stint, Peltz has devised two artistic episodes, to be undertaken on a later swing, just after cyclone season, when it gets stinking hot. The first will be a traditional Chinese opera, telling the story of Tom Price: The Man, The Town, and The Deep Cut of the Pilbara. <strong>The script, in Mandarin, includes scenes of workers betting on horses at the local pub, behind Peltz's backdrop of Mt Nameless, painted in Chinese-style brushwork. The event will be wildly incongruous with its surroundings, yet </strong>Peltz' decision to stage the opera was \"fairly intuitive\". In fact, the artist sees parallels with the mining process at every stage; \"The story will change based on the extraction, transport, processing and distribution network; in this case, composers, musicians, singers, sponsors. I'm looking to extract this resource from China, to dig it up and bring it to Tom Price.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo work regionally is to sacrifice whatever it is you can only get in a city: proximity to family, friends, cultural variety or a sense of belonging. During his residency, Peltz only saw his young daughter via Skype. There has been lively discussion in the press and academia this year about the effect of FIFO schedules upon mental wellbeing in the resources workforce. Tom Price was assembled almost artificially to furnish the mine with ready labour, but today there is no trace of any clock-on clock-off approach to its employees. In exchange for personal displacement, mining companies not only underwrite salaries, but community centres, gyms, counseling, schools, housing, festivals, insurance and health needs. Peltz describes these employment packages as \"attempts to provide the infrastructure necessary to sustain a human life\". Remoteness is essential to mining. There could never be a Paris or Sydney mine: its minerals could never be more lucrative than its real estate.<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428323687868/IMG_4063.jpeg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZU4yONF5nvZJk6KoW3mWjGkpeSOGsJszTAIUOrcA3dOznnPU3gEK_RmGwrtpla2PUKaIrLa-LoVfaUQL3gyJuPlY8KXi\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZU4yONF5nvZJk6KoW3mWjGkpeSOGsJszTAIUOrcA3dOznnPU3gEK_RmGwrtpla2PUKaIrLa-LoVfaUQL3gyJuPlY8KXi=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tPeltz's second proposal, a \"simple gesture\", depends on the cooperation of Rio Tinto. \"I'd like to travel with a bit of iron ore\", he says, \"from Tom Price, to Dampier, to a port and a steel mill.\" He hopes to gain access to the mine site, extract a single scoop of ore and to carry it to China, where it will resume its intended course. Clasped in Peltz's hand, it shall convey the length and internationality of the journey of Australian resources. Considering this effort, the gesture seems more outrageous than \"simple\". It also echoes that other fistful of Australian sand, returned by Gough Whitlam in 1975 to the custodianship of Gurindji leader Vincent Lingiari, signifying the restoration Waddi Creek to its traditional owners. Both are gestures of vast inter-cultural proportion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe SPACED residency model is designed to allow location to inform artmaking. Long engagements are a central strategy in Peltz's practice, allowing him to outwardly 'play' the researcher. In exploring Tom Price, Peltz takes on the air of an HG Wells character: an enquiring socio-naturalist, muttering \"how curious\" and scribbling notes during his poetic evening strolls. But what does the town believe a resident artist does? \"There is significant ambiguity about it,\" Peltz explains. \"I am curious about the expectations people have of my role and the role of art in their lives. Things are asked of me, design or documentation work. I enjoy engaging in those processes. They develop my relationship to the place and provide social access. It is interesting to be in a position to give freely of your labor in a place where so many people come to have theirs valued.\" Prompted by this overwhelming focus on efficiency, Peltz has endowed the role of resident artist with functionality. \"I see the work as something that exists for the current population of the town and lives on as a narrative of something that happened here,\" he notes. \"I'm not looking to write \"the\" history of Tom Price. I'm living a life and writing a story.\" We mustn't think of his residency as being <i>for</i> Tom Price, or <i>about</i> it, but simply <i>of </i>it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne cannot discuss mining without mentioning its theatricality. Both Peltz's proposals harness its internationality and vast organizational scope. \"The narrative of mining is often based on shock and awe: the overwhelming scale of the machinery, the resource extracted, the raw monetary scale. The information is beyond comprehension; it provides perspective and forces us to lose perspective.\" Mining is also a process of re-landscaping. Despite the Earth's many and varied regions, our resource exchanges can redistribute useful parts of the landscape on demand. The phrase 'naturally occurring' was never less relevant. Still, it is easy to forget the Odyssean reach of such projects. You might purchase an iron magnet, or a steel fork, blind to the grand journey the materials have been on, from ancient compressed earth, through countries, trains and plants, to be stickered with a price and sold into your hand. Daniel Peltz overrides our tendency to abstract an object from its origins. He makes visible again the money, machinery and manpower of the production cycle. \"Social scale is an important part of the way I think and work. It's a global industry located in the bush that continues to require tens of thousands of people to displace themselves from their lives and families in order to extract the riches embedded inside mountains.\" ­­­ <br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428323707922/IMG_4328.jpeg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pXzBFy6ZD9o_Q7LkbnUpcD8CLq8iwHW41LlQZz75g0wzXOsBveClxL5FdwpTSFl7IODJzI3Q2HGQCtkvQKkdGMRhfac\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pXzBFy6ZD9o_Q7LkbnUpcD8CLq8iwHW41LlQZz75g0wzXOsBveClxL5FdwpTSFl7IODJzI3Q2HGQCtkvQKkdGMRhfac=s1200\"></a></figure>",

        "article": "<p>\n\tFew years ago I heard the story about the founder of eBay Pierre Omidyar who, while operating in an early version of the platform, put on sale a broken laser pointer. Though Pierre was just using the item to test the system, he sold it for $14.83. When he contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the pointer was broken, the buyer simply replied he was a collector of broken laser pointers, proving in fact the validity of his business idea. This anecdote caught my attention, not much for the umpteenth confirmation of how odd human beings are, but for a deeper reflection on the real value of non-functional objects. The Italian title for Donald Norman's bestseller on usability, <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> (Norman 1988), was <i>La Caffettiera del Masochista</i> (\"Coffeepot for masochists\"), named from the picture on the book's cover, the French artist Jacques Carelman's coffeepot in which the handle is on the same side as the spout. From a semiotic point of view we just assume the object is not working, signifier and signified are in this case boldly declaring what, how and which purpose the object is supposed to satisfy. In reality what we've learned by the switch from classical to cognitive ergonomic, and what Carelman's piece title suggests, is that functions can lie in emotions, environments and social relations as much as on geometrical proportions and mere physical comfort.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428840259406/img1.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Waus3H0AhIeK18sqeicZX12dCnY3AIQOpVbovrtFIsvJv1RNWNp7zvs2iKfSNdVfeHFzoABQ1jrewsH8AMMNE0iiIjyh\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Waus3H0AhIeK18sqeicZX12dCnY3AIQOpVbovrtFIsvJv1RNWNp7zvs2iKfSNdVfeHFzoABQ1jrewsH8AMMNE0iiIjyh=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tObjects can be defined as the sum of physical and social rules (Proni 2002); the form of the woman's bicycle, for instance, was designed to respect the social rule requiring women to wear long skirts and conceal their legs. Function - represented by the frame's shape - and social rules – in the guise of woman's dignity, are here directly connected. Breaking the natural link between physical and social, and approaching them independently, more complex constructs can be fostered and unexpected land discovered. The <i>Art Furniture Collection</i> (Boym 2006) is an example of this dichotomy's misalignment. Chairs and benches are made by real art pieces where the painted canvases have been transformed into common upholstery. Social rules would deny you sitting on a painting, turning these functional furniture in non-functional objects; on the contrary, if the priority is given to the act of sitting, the piece of art is, in this case, the one destined to become non-functional.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428840281209/image2.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4peEjZxn4f0ttezonG_l0yDZ9oXAtwMQkfzepjADfdX1S3v2mM7dl72XiQoH6xrtAjDdmdsmz7L-wKsB2IEjkprGGAo\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4peEjZxn4f0ttezonG_l0yDZ9oXAtwMQkfzepjADfdX1S3v2mM7dl72XiQoH6xrtAjDdmdsmz7L-wKsB2IEjkprGGAo=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tOften non-functional objects are described as useless or, even worst non-sense; following new parameters, these adjectives can eventually overlap and contribute to enrich the debate on objects' utilitarian or philosophical nature. In the 50's Marvin Minsky, artificial-intelligence expert and professor emeritus at MIT, gave birth to a small box with an on/off switch and a hinged lid. When the switch was turned on a lever pops out turning the switch off, and then retreats. The machine's sole purpose was apparently to turn itself off after being turned on. The device was named \"The Useless Machine\", explicitly declaring its non-functionality. During the 60's a version of the same machine, called \"The Monster Inside the Box\", appeared on the market.In a creepy attempt to fill uselessness up with narrative: the function was restored thanks to a naughty monster playing jokes.A different interpretation of the same back-to-the-function effort can be found on the book \"The Freudian Robot,\" where Columbia University professor Lydia H. Liu wrote that the useless machine reflects an \"intuitive grasp of a fundamental problem of the unconscious that Freud has termed the death drive.\" In both cases there is a sort of resistance to futility that triggers some questions about the realism of non-functionality. Both functions, added at a later stage, are symbolic and set the dialogue far from the physical world (the monster in the box clearly looks at fictional environments while the unconscious Freudian theories are referring to a mere psychological and existentialist context). Reality and Fiction become indeed part of the equation together with functionality and non-functionality.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428840297108/image3.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_cSIVFLMn12Hu9VvLUYbmIQL3nluGCjVCRAi3JiNYvLUc-xodT9oxakcEqR07Aev5mTbZGhB4B5Ixb6XSu-vpDHJQre\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_cSIVFLMn12Hu9VvLUYbmIQL3nluGCjVCRAi3JiNYvLUc-xodT9oxakcEqR07Aev5mTbZGhB4B5Ixb6XSu-vpDHJQre=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tBaudrillard classifies everyday objects as functional, non-functional and meta-functional. His treatment of non-functional or \"marginal\" objects focuses on antiques and the psychology of collecting, while the meta-functional category extends to the useless, the aberrant and even the \"schizofunctional\" (Baudrilliard, The System of Objects, 1968). The meta-functional sphere, describes objects completely taken over by the imaginary suggesting a strong relation between reality and fiction and how in \"hyperrealistic\" situations \"the signs of the real\" are substituted for the real.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBaudrillard's work is frequently associated with postmodernism and is significant that Heinrich Klotz asserted that the matter of post-modernism is \"not just function but fiction\" marking the predominant role of imaginary and speculations for the years to come. Upgrading the initial given definition of non-functional objects and embracing then the more complex and articulated description of meta-functional objects, a new typology of functionalism can be recognized in fictional context. <i>The MacGaffin Library</i> (Noam Toran 2008) is a design fiction project based on the production of objects without a clear and declared function but to be used as prompts for film synopses. Hitchcock coined the definition <i>MacGuffin</i> to describe cinematic plot devices, usually objects, able to set and keep the story in motion despite lacking intrinsic importance. One of the most interesting pieces of this collection is a 3d printed brit-style teapot with a Nazis' eagle-plus-swastika decoration on top; the hidden scenario suggested by this particular MacGaffin was about a fictitious Adolf Hitler, after the conquest of the entire Europe, taking residency at Buckingham Palace, appointing Princess Margaret his bed warmer, Churchill his butler and starting a process to pacify the English population. Here the object is present but is non-functioning mechanically - you cannot make tea with it -, it is non-functioning as souvenir or memento – it talks about an event that never happened -, but is actually meta-functioning as real artifact - been produced and physically present -, and it is <i>meta-fictional</i> – not fully fictional neither fully real.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428840310709/image4.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K6271IAneoRcYmIKkU3PfkhYu7t-SrgmnJEosjnWCEtWchx7W4iYAaK9dXNKoBzKcX1VTMlM2nbNvFiEjLdlIyGb9qpn\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K6271IAneoRcYmIKkU3PfkhYu7t-SrgmnJEosjnWCEtWchx7W4iYAaK9dXNKoBzKcX1VTMlM2nbNvFiEjLdlIyGb9qpn=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tLooking at systems engineering something similar can be found. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement\" title=\"Functional requirement\">Functional requirements</a>, in this specific context, define specific behavior or functions while a non-functional requirement is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement\" title=\"Requirement\">requirement</a> that specifies criteria to judge the operation of a system. Functional requirements respond to what the system \"shall do\" and, on the other hand, non-functional requirements respond to what the system \"shall be\". Focusing on the \"be\" and using the \"do\" as a prompt to serve the \"be\" is what is partially happening in the fictional design world. In Design Fiction objects are often used as prompts or \"diegetic prototypes\" (Sterling 2011) and their speculative functions, or non-functions, are just mediums to understand and highlight deeper social implications.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBack to the relation between physical attributes and social constrains, the possibility to disconnect Functions from any preconceived socio-political-economical constrain enables the creation of brand new connection and a new meanings. The <i>Afterlife</i> device (Auger-Loizeau 2009) converts the chemical potential of dead bodies into usable electrical energy. The function, materialized into a power storage device, has been separated from the contextual limit of present religious and ethical perspectives. <i>Afterlife</i> used fiction to improve the level of acceptance of a functional idea covering it under a meta-functional veil and setting the scenario in a place suspended between impossible and real, the meta-fictional space.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428840324566/image5.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bdZl03Pxw0zHrTbGBAa2zyYRLJWDeLRZmRHE78B5KOYGaqWkQWaqnuKHklr9U5f9Tn6cpbNWmvLq1-2lua6AB2VfGiDt\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bdZl03Pxw0zHrTbGBAa2zyYRLJWDeLRZmRHE78B5KOYGaqWkQWaqnuKHklr9U5f9Tn6cpbNWmvLq1-2lua6AB2VfGiDt=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe peculiar evolutionary process that sees objects passing from being functional, non-functional, meta-functional to finally incorporate a meta-fictional nature is only part of the complex system that manages our relation with products. This body of definitions is not vanishing when a new one is introduced; they keep living side-by-side making our understanding and ability to decode and differentiate their meanings every time more difficult.\n</p>",

It was also the receipt of such enormous criticism that Snow later wrote <i>The Two Cultures: A Second Look </i>(1963)<i>. </i> In the last few months David Armitage and I have experienced a technologically-accelerated version of the same. In the 21st Century, this debate happens not only between colleagues, but also via pseudonymous blogs and retweeted punchlines.<br>\n\t <br>\n\t When we published <i>The History Manifesto</i> in October, we set out to rouse a debate in the university, and in history departments in particular, about the methods and ambitions of our profession in a moment of global warming, growing inequality, academic specialization, and short-term thinking. The debate took off beyond our wildest dreams; usually positive, sometimes controversial, and even occasionally dipping into extreme ire as individual personalities took issue with our text, some of them choosing to duel in the footnotes instead of to engage the substantive, positive vision that we wrote to offer. A deliberation of this variety and passion on all sides is evidence, we believe, of a healthy engagement by the profession. Like others creatures, when historians are aroused, they experience emotions, sometimes violently. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t Passion and critique redound on the internet, mirrored and intensified beyond the bounds of normal scholarly discourse, where debates are moderated by editors as well as conventions of reasonable politeness, in ways that can be particularly dangerous for junior faculty. In the voicing of criticism online, the norms of academic discourse disappear. Online enthusiasms that use heated rhetoric to suggest that an argument has been totally eviscerated can distract from the question of which data and issues are at the core of a professional debate, and which are illustrations that can be overlooked without harm to the major argument. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t The even-handed, respectful tone of civil debate that we saw in published book reviews in history journals -- the majority of which were positive -- disappeared on Twitter and the blogs. A journal editor noted in his published introduction how the tone of the unsolicited critique of our book were out of keeping with normal practice at that journal. The norms of scholarly civility were tinged with a form of rhetoric colored by strong pronouncements. It is my intention here to raise the question of the degree to which those strong pronouncements pertained to the culture and rhetoric of the internet, where one strand of academic debate originated as a result of our open-access publishing venture. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t Online debates bring particular challenges when they concern the debating of footnotes that this debate has involved. In an earlier blog entry, I told the story of an anonymous twitter personality, \"Pseudoerasmus,\" whose critique was cited by senior colleagues in their footnotes as evidence of sloppy scholarship. The critique appears largely to stem from an individual who is unfamiliar with historians' conventions of writing and footnoting. Where critics pointed to individual footnotes that could be tightened or prose made more accurate, we accepted their criticisms. Indeed, many of the most heated critiques that appeared first on on the internet were leveled against details and footnotes rather than the major argument. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t As we examined the criticism, we found most of it to be taking issue with footnotes that could be fit the text better and summaries of economists' work that could be made more precise. Very little of the most heated criticism on the internet (or in the printed engagements that quoted the internet) engaged substantively with the larger arguments that we had made about the tradition of a place of political engagement in professional scholarship in the social sciences, or about the questions of time-scale raised by new work by our colleagues, or about how visualization and digital analysis can help to tell stories on a greater scale.  <br>\n\t <br>\n\t On the internet, claims that one of these complaints had destabilized our argument circulate like a rumor mill. A provocatively titled tweet ran, for example, \"stunning take-down of the #historymanifesto!\" The tweet easily circulated among even our friends and colleagues, and not necessarily because they agreed that the take-down was successful. \"Retweets\" very rarely equal endorsement; I myself have been wont to retweet articles whose headlines I disagree with when I am saving them for myself to read later. Yet even in such cases the headline circulates nonetheless, perhaps because many people thought the text was important enough that a debate should be read. And for those who idly read the headlines on twitter, it was easy to get the impression that a \"take-down\" had happened. I wonder how many colleagues absorbed that rumor, and dismissed the need to read the book themselves. Even very clever people are sometimes put off by a rumor of that sort.  <br>\n\t <br>\n\t It is hard to debate online in spaces where identity is so fluid, as it can increase the vulnerability of a scholar up for tenure, while disguising some of her critics. It was me, the untenured member of our writing collaboration, who was targeted by an anonymous twitter personality for his original attack, on the grounds that due to her relative inexperience, it was she, not her senior collaborator, who must have been responsible for any errors in the text. The attack explicitly singled me out as the faulty party, an assumption that revolved around bizarre notions of authorship that certainly did not apply to our collaboration. In the process, standards of authorship circulating on the internet, not in the world of scholarship, were applied to tarnish my reputation as a scholar. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t When scholars at other institutions and editors of journals in my field retweeted the headline of a \"take-down,\" they may have appeared to some readers to be buying into this faulty understanding of authorship and intention. Without paying careful attention to how claims circulated and where, it would be easy for someone arriving at this conversation for the first time to misread the retweets as a vindication of the Manifesto's critics. Effectively, if such misunderstanding as I have construed has happened in the scholarly community, it would mean that the voice of one anonymous twitter personality and a handful of critics were promoted above the dozens of positive reviews published in scholarly journals by accredited peers across the academy. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t This is a dangerous system of ranking, and it represents a novelty in academic practice that we should note and try to understand as a mechanism. The academy has evolved, over time, its own standards for understanding praise, blame, and dissent, culling consensus through the slow-moving process of publication itself as well as the published reviews. Where much academic favor depends on reputation, besmirching rumors started on the twitterverse can do immense harm to the scholar whose career is just beginning. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t Internet publishing also brings challenges in the form of the sheer workload that a scholar must take on in order to stay engaged. Praise, critique, suggestions and invitations flooded in over the first few months of the <i>Manifesto'</i>s release. We soon found that we were inundated by more than we could, ourselves, respond to in detail. Our critics, while small in number, were prolific writers and tweeters. Their schedule also differed in its intensity from that of traditional academic review, which has some respect for holidays and academic schedules; two senior scholars released their critique the day before Christmas Eve. The intensity of the same writers kept up over formal and informal blog entries that continued over the following months. In the five days after <i>American Historical Review </i>published our reply to our critics on its front page together with the editor's congratulations, one of our senior critics has released to the internet two further \"take-downs\". When traditional book reviews may take six months to two years to appear, and then tend to take the form of a single reply, the volume of praise and criticism that can meet a text with a life on the internet dwarfs that of traditional scholarly encounters, and it can be hard to navigate in the midst of the other academic obligations.<br>\n\t <br>\n\t As I described in an earlier blog post, paying attention to which feedback to accept and which to reject on the wide berth of the internet is more complicated than it is in the format of a traditional journal or book revision process, where the scholar responds to criticism from 3-5 pre-selected scholars with expertise in their field. But readers on the internet do not necessarily share the same expectations of expertise as the authors, or even as other scholars in the field. As any scholar who has passed through the process of revising an article for journal acceptance knows, the process of considering these critiques is time-consuming. In bulk, without the guiding hand of an editor familiar with the interlocutors who has his own vision of what feedback to prioritize, the process of revision can be even more time-consuming. Online publishing is not a arena that a junior scholar should enter without caution about the time-consuming nature of the work, should the debate take off.<br>\n\t <br>\n\t Together, these burdens -- the inflation of trivial critiques, the spread of rumor generated in communities with different standards for authorship and excellence, the weight of time to keep up with a discourse at volume -- generate particular vulnerabilities for junior scholars of any gender who engage with discipline-wide questions on the internet. By engaging in open-access publishing, where the text freely circulates to a public -- and not just a public committed to visiting the bookstore, paying money, or accessing a subscription behind a paywall -- they may inadvertently may place their reputation in the way of anonymous critics, academic incivility, and rumors spread by casual retweets. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t The burdens of online criticism also redound differently through the hierarchy of the academy. For me as a junior scholar, the weight of these debates has particular ramifications for the processes ahead of me. The stakes are, of course, extremely real: rumors of scholarly malpractice or an ethical breach can result, especially in junior cases, in losing one's job. Will the relevant committees and meetings be swayed by these voices from the internet? There is no sanitary cordon that shields senior voting colleagues from debate online. When they meet it, will they interpret it as the sign of a passionate debate erupting in the context of a new technology that makes way for more heated debate than past generations of scholars have witnessed? Or will they be alienated by the fervency of the voices of some of our interlocutors and the intensity of their communications? The committees who will try to understand my case have likely viewed few examples of similar cases before. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t Public opinion matters in those rooms, and it is not the only thing that matters; scholarly consensus matters, and a range of opinion from the extremely positive to the extremely negative may be a sign of successfully engaging a disciplinary-wide controversy. Engaging with new forms of publishing and critique in the name of helping our institutions (departments, universities, libraries, and publishing-houses) to evolve may be taken as a sign of a commitment to institution-building. How my own case will be read has not yet been decided, although my hope is that they will be cognizant of the importance of engaging the issues at the heart of our discipline that cause such passionate eruptions, as well as the vitality of working with established academic publishers like Cambridge University Press in frontier spaces of innovative publishing. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t I would necessarily advise caution, or at least a clear-eyed sense of reality, to younger scholars contemplating the same path. Nevertheless, it is a collective burden that we come to understand the evolving nature of scholarly discourse online, together with the opportunities and challenges it represents. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t My engagement with the discipline of history and new opportunities represented by the digital was commissioned by a series of awards and fellowships, from a Mellon fellowship in Digital History to a later fellowship at the Metalab to my current position as an assistant professor of Britain and its Empire who has been encouraged by senior faculty, my chair, and various administrators around the university to continue research, publishing, and teaching about these new technologies. My opinions and work did not come as a surprise to any of those bodies of scholars. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t For me, the research, teaching, and publishing experiment of <i>The History Manifesto </i>followed seamlessly from the writing, research, and teaching about the digital humanities that I had been pursuing for six years already. My own contributions to <i>The History Manifesto </i>should be read in that light: the fruit of an officially-sanctioned project of research, teaching, and publication. I was the junior partner in a collaboration, offering my experience with digital tools and the possible audiences for history, reporting on an ongoing conversation with a senior partner who happened to be at the time chairing a major department of History. We hardly set out to offend our fellow-historians; instead, we were excited about new possibilities for research methodology, theories of history, publishing opportunities, and even political engagement on the part of history, and we wanted to report on this excitement to our fellow historians so that those who approved could play along themselves. We also hardly suspected that the criticism of a few senior faculty would find its way to the front page of the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education, </i>inflated from a few colorful tweets whose content revolved around editorial suggestions about footnotes and illustrations into a headline about shoddy data and ethical breaches in publishing. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t I myself do not believe that these charges would have happened were it not for open-access publishing and our attempt to engage an online community. Senior scholars might have still expressed their displeasure at our conclusions, but their opinion might have been limited to traditional venues, as its circulation would have as well. In other words, we are still very much learning about the opportunities and limits of scholarly engagement online, and about the way that scholarly engagements may open up new challenges for the junior faculty who are first to engage them.<br>\n\t <br>\n\t The virtue of having a text published online is that it immediately solicits input from readers. As advocates of rethinking publishing have noted for some time, online publishing has the opportunity to make less formal the traditional roles of anonymous reviewer, pre-publication, and post-publication manuscript. Immediate feedback gives authors the opportunity to constructively reflect on critique at any point in the publication process. We have not been shy about singing the praises of this kind of engagement, blogging in November about constructive criticism of a visualization. In January, we released a revised version of the text, both online and in hard copy, that took into account particular online criticisms of our phrasing and individual footnotes. We tightened ten lines of prose and changed five footnotes to better reflect the environmental debates in economics, although we did not substantively change our arguments. It is important for historians, other scholars, and publishers to contemplate what this new model of ongoing feedback offers to scholarship, raising humanism to the level of a field that can fluidly benefit from ongoing collaboration. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t Some of the praise of online publishing has been overstated. Critics of traditional publishing in academia like Kathleen Fitzpatrick have argued that publishing on the internet could potentially free the humanities of abuse by removing the temptations to abuse that were structural in the blind peer review system used by academic journals, a system that shields senior scholars while promoting discrimination against junior scholars, women, and minorities. Our own experience with online community criticism suggests that blind peer review possesses a monopoly neither on anonymity, nor on senior scholars flexing their power to promote and denounce new ideas, nor on outright hostility. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t There is a vein of feminist criticism where \"dangerous places\" are viewed as a positive challenge for radical intellectuals. Indeed, in the news cycle of the past year, the female game designers and their advocates were attacked on twitter with threats of gang rape and murder in the \"GamerGate\" controversy, demonstrating what an unsafe space the internet can be. But the women in question rallied, many of them refusing to go offline, several of them publishing incredibly moving memoirs of their experience. Some of them, including Anita Sarkeesian and Randi Harper, fought back with games and code, the tools of the attackers themselves. In so doing, they have turned a vicious fight into an opportunity for building solidarity between women in technology and rallying consumers of video games in the direction of social awareness. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t Academic attacks are almost certainly easier to endure than rape and death threats. All the same, engaging our interlocutors has been far from easy. On the internet, whether we are academics or gamers, we tame unsafe spaces by continuing to show up, and by continuing to insist on high standards for intellectual exchange and civility. We create safety by advocating for the respect due to vulnerable individuals like women, junior scholars and minorities. We have to show up in order to claim the spaces that need to be claimed. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t Is the internet itself really to blame for these heated emotions? Perhaps not; it might be the nature of manifesto-writing or polemic essays on the state of the academy in general that arouses so much emotion. Writing decades ago, C. P. Snow would've recognized that pattern after the flood of articles and letters, \"praise, blame…accumulating at an accelerating pace,\" that piled in after he published <i>The Two Cultures </i>(1959). \"Do certain kinds of animosity lead to an inability to perform the physical act of reading?\" he asked. \"The evidence suggests so.\"  Snow's own conclusion, published four years later as is rather like our own: the resulting hubbub was about a <i>Zeitgeist</i> in conflict; the particular acts of vitriol or praise, in the end, \"hadn't much connection with me.\" The same might be said for the victims of sexual aggression in many eras, before the internet and including it: they needn't take the aggression personally, for at the end of the day, the emotions come from deep cultural sources around us.  <br>\n\t <br>\n\t On the other hand, the internet is most certainly a new sphere of civil discourse. We might imagine that humans need to learn how to inhabit it, how to behave in public. Perhaps we are only beginning the process of learning what to say in public, and our culture (as well as our institutions) need to be patient as we do so. Just as publishing houses and educational institutions need to come to understand anew the rules for engagement in an age of open-access publishing, just so we as scholars will have to convene to make up our minds about when we accept the word of rumor, twitter, or a handful of internet-published critics, and when we defer to the published authority of our traditional journals. <br>\n\t <br>\n\t On a more individual level, we as scholars or as public intellectuals participating on the internet have ethical choices to make about the tone we take when leveling criticism at a peer. Should we throw out civil discourse because we are limited to 140 characters and are thrilled by the prospect of a retweet of a scandal-mongering headline? Should we target a scholar's reputation as a whole when a complaint is with an illustration, a footnote, or a political point of view? Journalists have done an excellent job of documenting, these last few months, how rumor spreads on the internet, and some have made a case that we are seeing the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0\">development of a new culture of public shaming</a>, unparalleled, perhaps, since the Puritans.<br>\n\t <br>\n\t Public intellectuals of all kinds today must make up their minds how they participate online, given that a technology for constant circulation of opinion and critique arrives in the middle of a culture that cleaves to event and scandal, that circulates headlines without necessarily agreeing with them. As anyone who has run a seminar knows, keeping sage opinions and even-handed reading is a skill that has to be cultivated alongside an attention to detail. Even hackers online are forming a new consensus <a href=\"http://blog.ycombinator.com/new-hacker-news-guideline\">outlawing \"gratuitous negativity\"</a> from their boards in the name of promoting more critical thinking.<br>\n\t <br>\n\t In <i>The History Manifesto</i>, we argued for the importance of taking the long view on the university, the environment, and the economy, topics about which we argued that historians have a great deal to contribute. If we apply that lesson to our own experience, we might reason that it takes a long time to develop rules for productive debate in a new social context. The internet may not be there yet, even when one's interlocutors are also respected scholars capable of civil discourse in many spheres. <br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428938371598/Battle_of_Bosworth_by_Philip_James_de_Loutherbourg.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tFpAGw21MX-BbTDkPi70ObGyFMaMTu4YazWCwKb0pUCHew1cb5hP8xx9uC3cx9oola6D8amswYq8x9AtWYZo4hGpnWE\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tFpAGw21MX-BbTDkPi70ObGyFMaMTu4YazWCwKb0pUCHew1cb5hP8xx9uC3cx9oola6D8amswYq8x9AtWYZo4hGpnWE=s1200\"></a><figcaption><br>\nBattle of Bosworth by Philip James de Loutherbourg</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>",

This course will provide an interdisciplinary reflection on the past, present and future of ecological urbanism. Cotaught between a liberal arts and an architecture professor, (but open to all majors) the course will attempt to interrogate the ways in which green urban design has been conceptualized to date. It will interrogate the limits of present conceptions and it will explore cutting edge contemporary debates around the future of the green urban project.\n</p>",

Working in a studio environment, we will iteratively design, fabricate, and critique projects, as we explore design problems and questions, and develop appropriate strategies for addressing those problems and questions. We will establish a foundation for design practice and creative process as we explore Human Centered Design, creative collaboration, exploratory play, ideation, iteration, woodworking, web design, graphic design, CAD modeling, 3D printing, CNC milling and laser cutting, amongst other fabrication techniques and design strategies – in addition to other strategies that enhance our creative processes - as we establish a technical and conceptual foundation for the design and fabrication of objects and experiences. We will document product and process throughout the semester, resulting in a portfolio of work by the end of the semester.\n\t<br>\n\tThis course takes place in the \n\t<a href=\"http://www.brown.edu/research/projects/design-workshop/\">Brown Design Workshop</a><br>\n\t<br>\n\tEnrollment limited to 16.

They were asked to document their process and product (using the STEAMstudio site, Facebook, and \n\t<a href=\"http://brownsteamstudio.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, integrating native social media into the blended + flipped classroom).

      "about": "<p>\n\tIn the face of widening social inequality, democratic decline and a basic erosion of the ecological health of the planet, many sections of design and the social sciences appear poised to take a critical turn. Emerging debates around \"speculative design\", \"re-directive practices\", \"discursive design\", \"adversarial design\" and \"transitional design\" all indicate an deep impatience with the status quo, a desire to challenge social and environmental injustices and a growing sense that things need to change and change quickly. Many currents of the social sciences would appear to be keen to move from endless deconstruction to reconstruction. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n\tModernist design has always been centrally linked to the consumer economy and technocratic modes of thinking. At the same time design - as a deeply materialist, agential and often utopian social practice has often been at the forefront driving forward other visions for living differently. Critical Design/Critical Futures would like to begin a conversation about the potential for creative dialogue and critique between critical design and the critical social sciences. We would like to open up a discussion about how we can think and teach critical design. We would like to think about the designer as worker and workers as self-organizing creative designers. We would like to critically interrogate the aesthetics of obfuscation that surrounds mainstream design. Finally, Critical Design/Critical Futures would like to consider how critical design, design activism and design lead social innovation might productively open up new horizons for speculative futures.\n</p>",

Before that Cameron was Director of Design Studies at the University of Technology, Sydney, and executive Director of Change Design, formerly known as the EcoDesign Foundation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCameron's primary area of research is sustainable design. In particular, he focuses on the design of systems that lower societal materials intensity, primarily by decoupling use and ownership - in other words, systems of shared use. Cameron has published a range of articles on the role of design, and in particular, service design, in the promotion of the sharing economy and collaborative consumption.\n</p>",

Sheridan's practice delves into cultural geography in order to study the history of landscape art and how it can be reshaped and fitted into contemporary living. Her PhD and current practice have revolved around a reconsideration of the cultural role that landscapes play in a digitally-dependent urban society. She asks whether the prevalence of the Internet, personal digital devices, GPS and geographical images tools have induced new ways of thinking about landscapes, space and environment, and whether today we have a new, digitally-appended mode for looking at the landscape. Sheridan has completed a BA, Honours and MA in visual art and in 2014 exhibited at The Daphne Collection in North Perth. Sheridan recently presented two research papers on contemporary landscape artmaking at the 2014 AAANZ conference and the biennial 2015 GANZA conference. She has also published writing in Art Monthly, Art Guide, RealTime Arts and Artlink.\n</p>",

Emerging debates around \"speculative design\", \"re-directive practices\", \"discursive design\", \"adversarial design\" and \"transitional design\" all indicate a deep impatience with the status quo, a desire to challenge social and environmental injustices and a growing sense that things need to change and change quickly. Many currents of the social sciences would appear to be keen to move from endless deconstruction to reconstruction. David Harvey's \n\t<em>Space of Hope</em> (2000) opened the new century with a call for critical theory to return to small, medium and large scale reconstructive visions so as to open up public discussion about alternative social futures. Erik Olin Wright has continued this call with the Real Utopias project (2010). Bruno Latour (2008) has more explicitly identified a politics of social design as a critical means through which the dilemmas of our age could \"make things public\" (2005).\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\tModernist design has always been centrally linked to the consumer economy and technocratic modes of thinking. At the same time design - as a deeply materialist, agential and often utopian social practice has often been at the forefront driving forward other visions for living differently. This conference would like to begin a conversation about the potential for creative dialogue and critique between critical design and the critical social sciences. We would like to open up a discussion about how we can think and teach critical design. We would like to think about the designer as worker and workers as self organizing creative designers. We would like to critically interrogate the aesthetics of obfuscation that surrounds mainstream design. Finally this conference would like to consider how critical design, design activism and design lead social innovation might productively open up new horizons for speculative futures.\n\t<br>\n</p>",

Workers could potentially be designers. Workplaces and the broader economy could potentially be subject to social design? Yet, the relationship between design, work and the potential for a worker-centered design is veiled. In this panel, we discuss the designer as a worker, the worker in design. We discuss the hidden histories of workers functioning as designers of co-operative and self organizing institutions and we consider the room for more co-operative and participatory working futures.\n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>",

Are there ways of making existing social relations and forms of human different more visible? How can we think about the creation of meaning, value and the creation of culture in ways that allow design to be more directly engaged with questions of social and environmental justice? This roundtable will grapple with some of these issues. \n\t<br>\n\t<br>\n</p>",
